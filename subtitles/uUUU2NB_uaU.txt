cody
[Music]
oh hello hey i don't know why you
decided to leave the house this is the
one place you knew we weren't going to
arrest him i know but i didn't think
anybody else didn't think he was alone
they can call the cops yeah well look i
think he should probably just avoid
going out in public for a little while
at least until we catch the actual
lunatic
okay officers come on cody come inside
junior i think it'd probably be better
if i just go home i'm tired of getting
tackled and put in handcuffs
unless it's ken doing it okay i'll see
you later cody okay
at least i'll be safe at home tyrone i
have a question
what is it baby make it quick you know i
don't like all that talking why do you
cheat on me
so much look baby it gives me time to
miss you
let me explain when i'm with another
chick and she starts to talk too much
i just think about you and i'm like man
i should go back to my wife right now
it's so sweet tyrone hey yeah you know
me baby hey mom and dad

him stay here he got arrested at his own
house yeah his parents thought he was
the lunatic and they called us look just
keep him here this time
oh okay junior i'm not safe anywhere oh
look you're gonna stay with me upstairs
no one's gonna call it coffee come on
so cody what do you want to do stay in
this room forever because i'm tired of
being arrested
oh i got an idea cody what if we put a
disguise on you and then people won't
recognize the jew
what like a goofy glasses and nose and
mustache
no no no better than that
better than that huh well cody look it's
the best disguise no one's gonna notice
it's you
well at least i don't look ridiculous
look i'm gonna prove it to you chef pee
pee get in here
oh what do you want junior who's that is
that crazy little dick in the skies
one that crazy lunatics in the house
he's under the sky no no no no no no
stop resisting
i'll get it who's that hello okay now
i'm getting mad well you said you were
gonna respond to any more calls this
address
yeah but when we get a call that he was
in a disguise that was really suspicious
you know especially because we said not
to leave the house
well we just want to go out in public
with them with a disguise okay okay fine
i'll tell you what how about we just
don't respond to any more calls from
this house tonight no matter what
no matter what no matter what all right
let's go come on cody yeah
sorry cody for the disguise idea junior
i'm just gonna sit right here and i'm
not gonna move until they catch the
lunatic
oh say that again i'm not gonna move
until they catch the lunatic
say those last three words again catch
the lunatic we should catch the lunatic
junior the police haven't even caught
the lunatic what are we gonna do well if
we catch the lunatic then no one's gonna
think you're the lunatic because olynyk
will be in jail
junior how are we gonna catch a lunatic
well to catch a lunatic
you gotta think like a lunatic and the
cops aren't thinking like a lunatic so
let's think about it the lunatic likes
to eat eyeballs
and shrek eats eyeballs in the movie he
says he squeezes the eyeballs and uses
jelly on toast
okay i don't really see where you're
going with this well if we can get an
eyeball
and put it by the front door then he'll
come find it and then we'll capture him
junior where are we going to get an
eyeball hmm i got an idea
in this bag of gross stretchy body part
toys okay but junior i don't think the
lunatic is just going door-to-door
looking for eyeballs to eat like
halloween candy look it's worth a shot
cody
do you want to stay in this room forever
no okay let's go put this eyeball by the
front door and if we catch them we call
the cops
all right cody there's the eyeball so
