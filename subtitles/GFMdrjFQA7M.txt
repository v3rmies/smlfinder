look officer officer i will pay you
to to not arrest her are you trying to
bribe a police officer well

my electricity bill is through the roof
so you could slide some cash my way i'd
really appreciate it

the one who threw the hammer i didn't
tell you to do that all right come on

have to put on some kid's bop or
something to drown it out what did none

goodman please drop the charges please i
don't want her to go to jail
no mario she's getting what she deserves
she has to face consequences for her own
actions well i know but she wasn't
trying to hit your car with the hammer
she was trying to hit me with the hammer
well then why wouldn't you want her to
go to jail for trying to hit you with a
hammer
i mean unless you're into that sort of
thing mario i mean i'm not judging
i like kinky stuff too although i
wouldn't want anyone hit me with a
hammer
unless i was paying for it so i will pay
for the damages on your car
no mario i don't need money i you think
that's what this is about
no mario i could just buy a new car she
needs to face consequences for her
actions although the jail is so dark
and scary and full of scary people well
then good
she's in there with the people just like
her it was just a mistake she was she
was mad
okay mario well when i'm mad i know not
to throw hammers at people's cars
because i was raised right look i
completely understand look
i will do anything i will do anything
for you to drop the charges please i'll
do anything
hmm well i did have to fire my
maid earlier today hmm
and she did wear a red thong when she
cleaned the house
so mario i guess if you're up for it you
could be my maid and wear a red thong
okay i did it nice what are you gonna do
now we'll just do everything i say and
i'll drop the charges hey you guys get
some earplugs because she will not stop
screaming and my kids bop cd has
scratches on it
whoa hey there hot stuff why are you
wearing a thong okay i'm trying to do
everything he says so that he'll drop
the charges
okay i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear
that because witness intimidation is
illegal
but i guess in this case it's more like
witness seduction right because oh

take her to jail i'll do anything
i'm sorry man she's gotta go to jail
