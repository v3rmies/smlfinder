think the same it'd be the smartest kid
in the world
it could be like an astronaut yeah oh
but we're boys we we can't have a kid
together

smart maybe he can invent like an
invention or something

this
um well i'm gonna be the daddy and since
i'm the daddy i still gotta go to school
cause i gotta provide for this family
okay so you're gonna go to school
tomorrow and i'll just be a stay-at-home
mom
all right junior so what i'm going to do
is i'm going to go to bed because i got
to get up early for school tomorrow
i'll see you later
look look we're going to uh we're going
to go
rocking the crib real quick
all right crafts since you all are so
stupid
we're going back to basic math so does
anyone know what one plus one equals
um one plus one equals three no
how much how how do your stupid brain
get three
one plus one how do you get three
because the two ones did it
and then they had the baby and then that
equals three people no
one plus one did not do it they numbers
how are they gonna do it
they ain't got pee pees and diaries one
plus one is two
no the answer is three because when two
people
do it and they have a baby that's three
people
explain to me how there's two unless
they did it with protection
but you didn't tell me that so the
answer is two
i don't wanna hear it one plus one
equals two my phone's ringing
