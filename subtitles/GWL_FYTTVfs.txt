cody's mom
yeah she's fat no an actual cow junior
they have to kill it
kill it yes something has to die to get
on that plate oh should they go to a cow
nursing home and wait for him to die of

healthy looking healthy
don't you like your cheeseburgers or not
anymore now that the cute animals for
i don't want to eat that where does
bacon come from pigs like the cops no
no actual pigs junior where do eggs come
from chickens
where did chickens come from eggs well
then what came first the chicken or the
egg i don't know junior
look just eat your food you're a
dinosaur right it shouldn't matter
joseph i don't think i want to eat
animals anymore or meat well
dude i'll eat it it wouldn't be the
first time i eaten an animal animal i
eaten a squirrel before
in a rabbit well well i don't believe
chef pee pee i don't believe it comes
from cows when they're young and healthy
i want to ask an expert okay okay dude
all right joseph i'm going to ask google
where does meat come from
oh there's a video oh let's watch it
dude
wait what are they doing that cow i
don't know dude
what are they doing turn it on take it
oh my god
oh it's okay it's frozen it won't exit
out what are you watching you better not
be on the hub wait what is this what are
you into
chef baby i just looked up how meat is
made and it's so cruel it's so
disgusting i'm never gonna eat meat ever
again so you're never gonna eat meat
again
nope never ever ever i'm gonna be a
person who doesn't eat meat what's that
called
it's a vegetarian junior yeah i'm gonna
be a vegetarian but what does that mean
they only eat vegetables and they don't
eat meat no no meat i hate vegetables
i'm not gonna be that
i'm only gonna eat mac and cheese that's
what i'm doing mac and cheese doesn't
hurt anybody oh yes it does
cheese comes from a cow you have to get
cheese from milk and milk comes from a
cow junior but i don't understand how
cheese comes from that
look you have to milk a cow and when
you're you're squeezing the udders
milk comes out but when you squeeze it
hard enough cheese comes out
i don't want to hurt the cow okay well
then i'm not gonna eat mac and cheese
i'm only gonna eat candy and drink soda
oh you better not eat any chocolate
there's milk and chocolate
well i'm only gonna eat jolly ranchers
and drink soda whatever look look have
fun with your diabetes junior all right
joseph let's go to the gas station and
get me some dinner tonight
okay dude all right got my jolly
ranchers
and i got my coke it even has my name on
it oh mine does too
they even had one with chef peepee's
name on it it spelled a little wrong but
you get the point
oh yeah yeah so this is all i have to
eat for dinner for the rest of my life
because you know i've never eaten meat
again oh me either dude especially after
watching that video
yeah me and you not eating meat saves
one animal's life then it's worth it
i just wish that nobody else would eat
animals i want everyone else to see that
video
but dude nobody cares about it i know
oh joseph i got an idea what dude what
if we steal every cow
every pig every chicken in the world and
put them in my house dude that sounds
reasonable yeah like
how many cows chicken and pigs do you
think there are oh maybe like 20.
yeah like yeah like 20. yeah they get
all fit in here and then we steal them
all the world's gonna think they went
extinct
and all they're gonna want to eat is
jolly ranchers oh dude that's a tedious
plan yeah yeah there's plenty of jolly
ranchers at the gas station oh yeah
but joseph i think this mission is too
big for just two kids to pull it off we
need one more kid who
i got him a four-eyed smart kid cody
no he won't leave his house anymore
that's gonna be harry oh harry
let's call him up okay hey guys sorry
i'm late i was really hungry so i picked
out some chicken filet
i love this stuff chick-fil-a oh no dude
harry you can't eat that
why not do you know what it's made of
chicken
you don't care no
well harry i'm not gonna let you eat
that okay paid 9.75 for that
harry you know a chicken died for that
yes so by you not eating it you just
saved a chicken's life
no cause it's already dead but but no
but by you not eating it it's gonna
prove that we don't want chicken anymore
and that no one's gonna eat it but
literally it's already dead so i could
have just eaten it no
look we're not gonna eat chicken anymore
all you're gonna do is eat jolly
ranchers because there's no animals and
jolly ranchers
but there's no nutritional value in
jolly ranchers yes there is
this one's green apple and this one's
wild cherry and
this one's blueberry those are all
fruits it's all nutritious
allow me to do an impersonation of your
president
rum you're so wrong you've never been
more wrong
build a wall well but nobody it's fruit
flavored so it has all the nutritional
stuff of fruit you are literally the
stupidest person i've ever met
well look harry look this is not why we
invited you over to argue about this
stuff
we need your help we need somebody
that's really smart me and joseph
want to go save every cow every pig and
every chicken in the entire world and
put them in my house so nobody can eat
them
that is literally impossible there are
millions of those animals
millions and joseph you told me there's
20. dude i counted 20. i know i did
there's 20. y'all are stupid they're
more oh okay wait
look we just need your help i want to go
save all these animals because i don't
want people to eat them
okay well guess what why don't you guys
go save one animal and let me know how
that goes
okay come on joseph we can save one
animal yeah let's go save one okay dude
oink oink
oink all right joseph there's your pig
and we're going to save its life we're
going to stop them from being turned
into bacon
genius idea we're going to be heroes
yeah we'll be heroes but i thought of
something joseph
if we steal that pig we're going to go
to jail and i don't want to go to jail
oh me either dude so i was thinking if
we can willingly get him to come with us
he'll be running away and it won't be
counted as stealing dude how do you come
up with these ideas
you're a mastermind i know he just comes
to me so uh how do you
how do we get his attention oh oh he
oinks so i'm going to get him okay
hey piggy oink oink oink what what did
you say
i said oink oh that's offensive to me
you think just because i'm a piggy
that i go oinked i could go ribbit if i
wanted too
i'm sorry for offending you yeah you
better be sorry
can you come talk to us for a second
what's in it for me freedom
yeah we'll free you okay i'm coming oh
joseph he's coming he's coming okay do
it
what do you think mozos wants well well
we want you to come with us
why because uh we're gonna take you to a
better place
but i like it here i get the peas and
poops wherever i want stews
yeah but if you come with us we'll be
able to take you to a nice house
where people won't try to eat you
because if you stay here someone's gonna
throw you in a meat grinder and you'll
be turning to bacon and put on a
cheeseburger
well how do i know you two aren't gonna
turn me into bacons or put me in the
meat grinders
well because we're here to save you just
trust us

vegetarians
give me a high broccoli hey that's what
i'm talking about
oix oh well just 10 million more piggies

like a lot regardless of how you say 10
million there's still a lot of piggies
yeah well you know what i saved one pig
and he's not gonna be turned into bacon
and he can go live a happy life inside
my house

free pig
he's about to poop all over your house
well that's fine but i'm gonna save all
10 million pigs and put them in this
house
that's a lot of poop hold on joseph what
dude i just realized
chef pee pee has a bunch of eggs in the
refrigerator oh no i have to save them
