so guys what do you want to do today
you guys are coming to my violin recital
tonight right what violin recital wait
you know how to play the violin
yeah listen stop it
you're giving me aids what do you guys
think oh that's awful cody yeah why
can't you play something cool at the
drums yeah or like the guitar well it
looks kind of like a guitar but it
doesn't sound like a guitar it sounds
like you're running over like a baby
kitten well i need you guys to come to
my violin recital because you're my best
friends
well i don't want to go sit through a
stupid violin recital all night i want
to play video games or something
but you guys never come to my violin
recitals look i thought you guys were my
best friends if you don't come to my
violin recital tonight i'm going to
assume that you hate me and you don't
want to be my friend anymore
okay we'll be there dude i don't want to
go to a stupid violin recital me either
but
cody said he will not be our friend
anymore are we though
are we his friend well look i don't want
to look for another friend and he's our
smart friend and we helped us cheat on
test at school
so we need him i guess so oh i got idea
what if i get grounded by my dad so that
i can't go tonight and i'll blame it on
my dad i'll say i can't go i'm grounded
how are you gonna get grounded by
tonight ooh
i know i'm gonna break my dad's tv he
loves watching tv he'll instantly ground
me for like a month
oh man i can't wait to watch tv wait
where did my tv go junior
uh dude what are you about to do i'm
about to slide down the stairs on my
dad's tv
uh dude you think this is a good idea
yeah it's gonna get me grounded i am not
going to that violin recital so push me
okay junior where are you
what are you doing
oh man that was so much fun i'm totally
grounded for this julia why did you
break my tv
because i wanted to ride it down the
stairs like a skateboard are you gonna
ground me ground you
no why not because i ordered a bigger
better tv yesterday i'm just mad and i
didn't get to ride it down the stairs
you beat me to it what
was it how was it was it fun huh huh
yeah it was really fun
oh it's my turn next oh my turn my turn
what
i thought that was totally gonna be
grounded
did you get grounded dude no why not
because my dad apparently bought a brand
new tv
and he was already gonna go down the
stairs like a skateboard so he didn't
care if i did it
so how are you gonna get grounded now i
don't know oh i know
i can photoshop a fake report card and
say that i got all s and i failed
he would definitely grab me for bad
grades right dude that's a perfect plan
yeah i'm gonna photoshop a bad report
card
all right joseph check these apps out
dude that looks awesome
it almost looks like a real report card
i know i only had to change like two of
them the rest of them were already f's
insane yeah so i'm gonna show this to my
dad and he'll definitely ground me for
failing right yeah
okay oh man this is gonna be so much fun
uh dad can i talk to you for a second
what now julia i'm trying to slide
downstairs on my tv
well look i want you to see my report
card it's all f's
oh yes yep i have to go to summer school
are you gonna ground me what
no no i'm not gonna grind you i'm glad
you're going to summer school but why
because i don't want to see you in the
house all summer i need some me time
okay
are you not going to ground me no it
looks like you grinded yourself with
those grades good luck working at
mcdonald's
[Applause]
did that get you granny dude no my dad
actually wants me to fail to go to
summer school
why because he wants the house to
himself and he knows i'll be at school
all summer oh
i guess it's harder to get grounded than
it seems yeah good thing i don't have
parents i could just fake my death so i
don't have to go to this violin recital
i wish getting grounded was easier than
faking to death
oh i got an idea my dad loves food and
chef pee pee's cooking right now if i go
mess up chef if he's cooking and my dad
can't eat then he'll definitely ground
me
dinner's ready man oh man i can't wait
to eat some chicken
hold on dad julia why did you just spit
in my food
yeah why did you just fit in his food
junior because your cooking sucks chef
pee pee
yeah yeah your cookie does suck chef pee
pee spit in it with me junior
wait why are you spending my food i just
cooked this look i hate you guys
cook something better next time then
you're not gonna ground me dad
no i was gonna spit it if you did it
look i spit in his food all the time
oh man why can't i get grounded
i give up you still not grounded dude no
i spit my dad's food and then he started
spitting in it with me
wow your family's weird i know i feel
like i'm never gonna get grounded
i guess i just feel that stupid violin
recital oh i have one last option
i can light some on fire in the house oh
dude yeah that'll always work
yeah he'll grab me as soon as he sees
fire he's gonna be like sure you're
you're grounded
yeah that sounds like your dad dude okay
i'm gonna go start i'm gonna light them
on fire
dad come in here you watch their fire in
the kitchen
because i wonder roast marshmallows are
you gonna ground me oh my god you

was like a birthday candle or something
because today's his birthday
