really really smart nerd
and this big fat dumb nerd wants to go
to school all summer instead of playing
video games with his boys

harvard is the most prestigious school
there is
why would you want to go to a school
named harvard it rhymes with hard
turd yeah it's very mature junior is
everyone constipated there
no guys it's the hardest school there is
to get into name one important person
that went to harvard i'll wait
okay mark zuckerberg he stole facebook
okay fine how about bill gates he got
divorced
but he's one of the richest men in the
world but all that money and going to
harvard and his wife still left him wow
what's so great about harvard
okay fine how about obama he was
president well not anymore
well he was president though well don't
you think if he went to harvard they
would want to be president longer but he
was president as long as you can be
president but
don't you think they would make an
exception like oh you went to harvard
we'll let you be president forever
going to harvard doesn't give you super
powers i bet superman didn't go to
harvard

can name more important people who
didn't go to harvard than did go to
harvard

he didn't go to harvard okay
jesus oh jesus yeah jesus didn't go to
harvard yep harvard wasn't around back

and come throw it on cody okay and i'm
gonna call the cops and say that's
something bad on them
okay dude hello hey there you call the
cops yes um my friend upstairs he has
grass all over him grass
yeah like illegal grass oh you mean

getting kind of short
i mean where is that criminal i'm gonna
get him oh he's upstairs all right
oh hey joseph where'd you guys go uh you

grows outside
oh so you're growing it too that's a
whole nother charm yeah officer aren't
you gonna arrest him so he doesn't go to
harvard because harvard won't accept a
criminal

or not he wants to give me some
well you can have it i mean there's a
whole yard full outside
oh okay he's not gonna arrest you
no junior's just grass all right joseph
i got another plan to get him to not go

that hey cody can you do me a favor can

junior that video's clearly been edited
no you said i cheat to get into harvard
you were just bragging about it
junior that sentence doesn't even make
sense i wouldn't have said i cheat to
get into harvard i would have said i
cheated to get into harvard oh i got to
do it i got it no we got it we got we
got it
oh damn it i cheated take it into
harvard oh i gotta do it i got it
oh damn it pretty incriminating evidence
yeah you know when he said oh damn it

that is proof
no no i was mad because i got tricked
into saying that
wait so you telling me you didn't say
what you said that you said

maybe 20 years from now
your mother i mean i mean tell your
mother i said hey
[Music]

you guys would ruin my whole life just
to hang out for one summer

friend
yeah yeah who's going to replace a big
fat nerd like you yeah we can't find a
bigger fat or nerd
yeah well at least we're all going to do
that fun stuff that you mentioned right
like going to egypt and skating down the
pyramids and drinking our own pee
oh yeah we're totally gonna do all that
stuff yeah
hey so that was just normal grass huh

fertilizer you're using but man that is
that is powerful
