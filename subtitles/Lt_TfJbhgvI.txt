more hell
oh okay okay all right jeffy now that
you learn to count to 50
count to 10.
that's your alphabets i know somewhere
in that stupid head you know how to
count the 10. the lights are on no one's
home but the security cameras at least
picked up some of it okay
so let's move on to the next thing okay
let's move on to
math and english he doesn't need to
learn english because he already speaks
english every day
so we just have to go on to math math
yes math
let's go learn some math yeah all right
jeffy now it's time to learn math and
we're gonna start with addition
and i know math is really hard it's
gonna be really tricky but i promise if
you just pay attention you'll get it
all right baby get the first card okay
jeffy here you go all right jeffy what
is two plus
two um 74. what how'd you get 74. i
pulled it out of my ass
jeffy where did you hear such language
danny taught me
marvin don't say marvin like on his dad
i didn't teach him that look jeffy i
really need you to try
what is two plus two baby two
what do you mean baby two well you got a
mommy two and a daddy two and they love
each other very much
and they had a baby too i would
understand you
if you thought those two twos had a baby
it would be two but but numbers don't
have genders jeffy so they can't have
babies
so look two plus two equals four how
does it equal
four the four looks nothing like the two
unless the two two is adopted in a four
or if this two is cheating on this two
with a four and then maybe that would be
three
jeffy look numbers cannot cheat on each
other numbers can't get married numbers
can't have babies the answer is four
two plus two is four let's move on to a
different card
here you go all right jeffy what is zero
plus zero two what how is it two
because they don't love each other on
that card jeffy no no no no listen
listen
why is two plus two baby two but zero
plus zero is it baby zero
because actually in this weird world
that you live in if zero plus zero
equals baby zero
that would actually be the right answer
because zero plus zero
is zero okay i'm so confused because
you're telling me zero point zero equals
zero
but two plus two doesn't equal baby two
i don't understand
okay zero plus zero equals zero but two
plus two equals four
daddy i am so confused i guess next
you're going to tell me
that 8 plus 8 equals 16 or something
that's right it does equal 16.
daddy you're talking crazy i don't
understand any of this oh go go have all
this help with this
okay just explain this to me how come
two plus two equals baby two but zero
plus zero equals two
because they love each other on this
card but they don't love each other on
that card how can you tell the zeros
don't love each other
because there's not a heart on that card
there's no heart on this card
well dang if you take this two and flip
it around and put it next to this two
it'll be a heart with a line underneath
it he's a genius
he's actually making sense he's a cheese
all right we're done with addition let's
move on to subtraction
maybe you're better with taking things
away all right jeffy now we're going to
learn subtraction
subtraction is when you take things away
like how you're taking years off my life
with all this stress
okay all right baby get the first card
all right jeffy here it is
all right jeffy what is eight minus four
eight what
how's it eight well because you have an
eight up here and you take away your
four
so the eight is left so the answer is
eight oh i see the confusion yeah i
understand how that makes sense
that if you take away the four would be
eight but no the answer's four
how is it four the four's already taking
off the card right there so
all that's left is the eighth well no
jeffy could look like two fours making
eight
we're not talking about two fours we
already have one four right here
and it's already subtracted so the
answer is eight
he has a point marvin i understand he
has a point but eight minus four
is four because it takes two fours to
make an eight you remove one of the four
is eight
stop bringing up two fours it's bad
enough we got one right here and that
one's already
taken off so stop bringing up the four
the four's gone
so eight is left the answer is four
eight minus four is four it's not eight
you have a four right here
you take the four off the card so what's
left
eight eight exactly am i wrong yes
how because eight minus four is four
no it's not the four is gone you don't
have another four
to add to it stop bringing up the four
you have a four
it's gone you subtracted four it's gone
a is yes you guess eight is left but no
it's it's fuller jeffy eight minus four
is four
screwed his helmet screwed his pencil
screw this diaper screw einstein
and screw newton the answer is eight
you take the four off the card and
answer that okay give me five right the
answer
a minus four is eight you got your
weight you know what you're right the
science is wrong all the scientists are
wrong all those people are wrong for
years and years and years everyone's
been wrong
eight minus four is eight okay that is
the official answer okay
yep all right let's move on he knows
math he's a genius at math he's a math
genius so
let's move on to art or something marvin
we need to go over english with him
we don't have to go over english you
just heard him yell at us in perfect
english right
marvin we're working on english next oh
he just
all right jeffy now you're gonna learn
english and i know you already know how
to speak english because you've been
yelling at me all day in english
but now you're gonna learn phonics how
to pronounce your words better
all right bring me the card all right
jeffy say frog
flog no see jeffy you're saying it wrong
you're saying fog you gotta say

oh you'll like this one jeffy why why
no it's yo-yo why why no no no no
don't read the top read the bottom yo yo
why why
no jeffy say yo yo why why
no act like a cool gangster yo yo why
why
marvin don't teach him that oh okay you
know what fine you know you already know
english i told you
he knows english he's a genius let's
move on to the next thing
here we go uh we got um uh art and
coloring he loves the color he loves
good at that yeah let's go call him with
some crayons
uh-oh look what we got here we got that
next picasso
look at him go a card a bug yes you did
and
what's that did you stay inside the
lines
yay jeffy yeah jeffy did a good boy
yeah jeffy did a good voice so we can
knock off coloring off that so all we
have to do
is teach him at least one sport that's
it hmm what about baseball
no no no baseball is too dangerous how
about t-ball
t-balls yeah t-ball is really easy and
no one will get hurt i like game ball i
i know you will you love t-ball
let's go learn t-ball all right jeffy
this is t-ball it's literally the
easiest sport in the world anybody can
play it see unlike baseball where
someone throws the ball at you really
fast
this ball is just sitting on a tee and
no one's moving it so all you have to do
is hit this ball
with your bat team ball yeah yeah just
hit this ball with that bat go
close jeffy
jeffy get him a bigger bat okay i think
if you have a bigger bat it might be
easier if you'd hit the ball
here you go jeffy careful there slugger
that's a big bat now try to hit the ball
you gotta hit the ball jeffy
you hit it the wrong way you gotta hit
that way
all right jeffy hit the ball oh marvin
i'm so sorry has the swelling gone down
at all
the doctor said my brain might
hemorrhage and you know what
that would be just fine
i'll get it i'll get it no no let's let
the injured guy go answer the door
the guy the guy you know who got hit in
the face with the baseball bat
hello hey marvin what the hell happened
to you t-ball
i didn't know t-ball was a contact sport
it's not huh
well anyway i'm here to administer jeffy
knock it off
good boy anyway i'm here to administer
jeffy's exam
well he's gonna fail it anyway so come
inside
well baby these are the last few minutes
we get to spend together before i go to
jail
do you think he's going to pass marvin
no no i don't i don't think he's going
to pass at all
i don't think there's any chance he's
going to pass he looks like he's
concentrating over there
oh he's concentrating well in that
marvin case it nope he did this while we
were watching the movie
marvin you know better than that nope he
does this all the time
okay fine he just does that all the time
marvin uh yes your son has finished
testing now oh man can you give me a few
minutes to say goodbye to my girlfriend
i know i'm going to jail well i would
like to say that your son passed with
flying colors he did i would like to say
that
but unfortunately over 90 of his exam
was wrong oh
i'm going to jail would you mind
explaining this to me
oh not this again yeah eight minus four
what is it marvin
it's four no it's not it's eight you see
because you have an eight up here
minus the four you take the four off the
paper what is it
eight eight eight is left so look jeffy
taught me this earlier
eight minus whatever number you have
down here is always
eight so if you're subtracting something
from the bigger number up top it's
always gonna be that bigger number down
below
and we're gonna give him an honorary
harvard degree
absolutely and we're going to be calling
it jeffy's law of subtraction what if it
doesn't make any sense 8 minus 4 is 4.
no it's not you have 8 up here take the
4 off the paper
what's left eight eight exactly it is
just like that with any other equation
but earlier it was eight minus four was
four i don't care what it was earlier
now it's eight minus four equals eight
you take the four
off the paper always you always take the
number that you're subtracting off the
paper and it's going to be the bigger
number
that doesn't make any that's stupid i
don't care if it's stupid or not
we're calling it jeffy's law of
subtraction and we're giving your son
your genius son a honorary harvard
degree
can you can you do me a favor can can
you shoot me in the head with this gun
[Music]
sure
