i'm gonna pause the game
i'm gonna go answer the door don't

uh hello hey there i got a call from a
child
like a like a really scared child who
said that his parents were fighting so
i'm gonna go ahead and come in what are
you talking about
we're not fighting a baby baby tell the
cop we're not fighting oh no no no we're
not fighting we're just smashing
oh okay well then i'm sorry for
interrupting that no no no no we're not
smashing either i wish we were doing
that
we're playing video games you know super
smash bros wait a minute i had three
lives before i left now i only have one
that means you unpause the game
no mario i wouldn't do that yes you
would because you suck at the game you
have the cheat to win
yeah yeah you unpause it that's why you
cheated
this is starting to kind of sound like
fighting no no no it's not fighting
we're just arguing over a video game
it's just a stupid argument
okay well we got a call about some
fighting going no no fighting just
arguing you know that's it oh good well
if you want to see a real couple fight
you should head over to my house it's
like wwe over there it gets crazy if my
wife even slightly burns dinner i put
her in a headlock and piledriver through
a table
yeah i got a storage unit full of tables
because she burns dinner a lot
anyway i don't want to get another call
making me come over here so i'll see you
later
except i don't want to see you later
because i don't want to come back here
mario we probably shouldn't fight in
front of jeffy anymore he's very
impressionable at this age it's just the
part where you guys go
see poppy see
hold on there's someone at the door
jeffy stop doing that uh hello
mario let me in what's going on this is
heavy let me in right now okay come on
come on
solid gold bars are so heavy how much is
all this gold worth
well mario the small gold bars are worth
a million dollars each
and the big gold bar is worth five
million dollars why do you have eight
million dollars worth of gold with you
because i'm trying to hide it from the
irs mario
why because they're trying to take 37
of my gold and that comes out to be 2
960 000 and the thought of that
just makes me want to rip my kneecaps
off this is my money and no one gets to
touch my money except for me
well then why do you have your gold here
because i'm trying to hide it mario
because the irs is going to be raiding
my house
and they're not going to find a single
penny why because it's going to be at
your poor house
okay so how long you want it here for
well mario just until the raid's over
okay so i'll be back when everything
cools down don't you touch my money okay
okay
i won't i won't touch it that's a lot of
money mario
i know i know i mean i could sell that
and get a million dollars like right now
mario we can't do that
i mean think about it baby that's eight
million dollars he's a billionaire he's
not gonna notice like one million
dollars goes missing mario but that's
stealing and it's dishonest
but it's a million dollars right in the
palm of my hands i can have it right now
we can't do that no mario
so what do we do then let's just sit
here and be poor that's
dumb i can have a million dollars mario
money isn't everything
