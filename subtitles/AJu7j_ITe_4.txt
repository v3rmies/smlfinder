we just want to take can you please just
sell tickets we won't tell anyone no i'm
gonna lose my job if i do that just wait
till you're older wait till we're older

oh i can't believe we didn't get to see
the movie yeah
stupid dumb have to be 18 rule yeah i
really wanted to see him kiss his sister
yeah what do we do now who i know why
don't we buy a lottery ticket if we win
the lottery then we can buy our own
movie theater and see all the rated r
movies we want
oh yeah that's a good idea dude oh
that'd be so cool no no no you have to
be 18 to buy a lottery ticket what you
have to be 18
yeah because i guess they don't want
kids to like win the lottery and then
spend the money on something stupid like
buying a movie theater just so they can
get in to see a rated r movie
you know what i'ma vote for president so
he can lower the a so we can go and see
rated our movies yeah well you have to
be 18 to vote too why do you want that
rule up
why well i guess they don't want kids
doing something stupid like voting for a
president just so he'll lower the age of
rated our movies
all right well how about we go get
tattoos on our faces yeah yeah
yeah yeah sit here on my lip yeah well
no cause because you have to be 18 to
get a tattoo
why come on well i guess they don't want
kids to do something stupid like get
face tattoos
well this is dumb you'd be 18 to do
everything i wish i was older
oh you know what i could make a device
that could make us older
really yeah this is a youtube video i
can do anything
well not anything but i could do that
well do it all right
