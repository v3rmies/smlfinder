i'd hang back and say it later so you're
not going to tell me happy birthday on
my birthday oh happy birthday junior i
don't wanna say it now you're only
saying it cause i'm mad well i i wanted
to say it before but i couldn't
you couldn't say three little words
happy birthday junior that's two words
i thought you supposed to be smart it's
happy birthday but no junior birthday is
one word
it's two words oh okay look uh cody
listen to this when women have a baby
it's called
and what's today it's a day it's just a
day to you it's just a normal day it's
not my birthday what junior come on so
you forgot my birthday just say it you
forgot my birthday that's why you didn't
say it i didn't forget your birthday yes
you did you only said it after joseph
said
i called you out on it yeah dude junior
no you literally just said it's my
birthday today so of course i knew it
was your birthday i have to tell you
guys it's my birthday i never said it
was my birthday
you just said it a minute ago joseph
thank you for remembering my birthday oh
no problem dude you know i'm a good
friend i'm always here for you bro and
i'm turning 12 years old and since i'm
12
i'm a big boy and i can do so much more
stuff than when i was 11. like what
uh like i can uh stay up past 9 p.m
and i can uh ride a bicycle without
training wheels
i've never seen you ride a bike and i
can also um put together a thousand
piece puzzle without eating the pieces
or choking on them
no you can't junior yes i can really
okay here's the pieces do it uh
show them dude yeah i i totally can put
this puzzle together without choking on
the pieces
like the box says just
dude
junior i told you you can't do it the
pieces just look so delicious
i know junior nobody can put together a
puzzle without trying to eat the pieces
until they're at least 13.
i know they're just so colorful and
weirdly shaped and you can't help but
wonder what they'd feel like in your
mouth
see junior i told you they're just so
bite-sized and they melt in your mouth
yeah let's get rid of these pieces i
don't want to choke
all right guys i got rid of all the
pieces so we're not going to choke uh
junior
what you forgot a piece dude stop me
spit it out spit it out oh dude it
almost had me i know stupid puzzle
pieces
all right guys so you're saying that now
that i'm 12 i can't do anything cool no
junior well what age can i start doing
cool stuff uh 65.
65. what can i do at 65. well you could
retire play checkers and then die
i don't want to do that yet ooh when
you're 21 you can drink what
really no way yeah you can drink it 21.
no dude he's lying
he's lying you're telling me at 21 i can
drink a glass of water yeah
can i use a straw i don't know about a
straw but you can drink what about
hawaiian punch yeah definitely so i can
drink liquids at 21. yeah
dude that's crazy imagine eating
mcdonald's and being able to drink a
sprite with it
i can finally have the travis scott meal
yeah with the sprite oh
that's right dude okay okay cody okay so
um i want to be 21.
you gotta wait nine more years junior i
don't want to wait nine years that was
long i wish there was a way to be older
faster
it is dude what you don't turn 12 until
you blow out your candles
oh yeah yeah that's true yeah however
many candles that are on your cake when
you blow them out that's how old you are
yeah really yeah so if you change the 12
to a 21 on your cake and the candles and
then you blow out the candles you'll be
21.
it really works like that yeah okay so
let's go change my candle to 21 and i'll
blow it out
okay let's go do that all right guys
here's my cake
happy birthday junior junior they
spelled your name wrong no they didn't
that's not how you spelled junior yeah
it is like read it that's just the month
of june and then here
it says junior my name is junior but no
your name has an i
in it no it no it doesn't where's the e
it's it's in the eye it's the junior
year okay you're just making that up
joseph can you read that for me
uh happy birthday junior yeah it spells
junior right joseph um

move the candles to 21. all right cody
is that 21
