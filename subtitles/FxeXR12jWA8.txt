[Music]
all right jeffy i uploaded our video and
i titled it chef pee
pee prank hilarious so funny ha ha gone
wrong with hammer
oh sweet junior how many views we got we
got a rocking
five views okay well how many until we
get our gold play button well we need a
million subscribers
and if we assume that the five people
that watch to subscribe we still need
a bunch of subscribers like we're not
even close oh dang it junior
i want my gold play button now i'm tired
of waiting i'm tired of waiting too i
wish i had a gold play button like right
now but i think it's gonna take us a
couple years
well what about this super mario logan
guy he's got 38
m views that means million wait he has
to have a gold play button
but what if we break into his house and
we try to steal his gold play button oh
i think we should totally do that junior
let's google his address yes google's
address and see if it pops
up all right jeffy look his address is
online
peepee we should totally go there and
steal his gold play button i mean his
address is online so he's basically
begging us to come steal his gold play
button
right right like we should show up at
night time and say we're fans because
he's gonna think we're fans and we're
gonna ask to take a picture of the gold
play button and when he's not looking
we're gonna snatch it
yeah junior let's go let's go to his
house right now let's go right now
all right jeffy there's his house and
he's got the lambo sitting out front i
called dibs we're not stealing the lambo
oh come on junior please
okay fine if we see the key sitting
around we'll steal the lambo yes all
right so we're gonna knock on the door
pretend we're fans and when he lets us
in we're gonna steal the gold play
button um
junior i think we should take these ski
masks off or else he's gonna think that
we're gonna rob the place
well we don't want him to see our
identity because if he sees us when we
steal he's gonna call the cops on us and
know who we are
yeah but if he sees this in masks he
already might call the police so i think
we should take him off okay how about
you take the mask off and pretend to be
a fan and when you get in the house
you open the window so i can sneak in
with a mask on and take the gold play
button and he'll never know
that i was stuck inside the house could
you open up a window oh good idea junior
let's do that all right you go to the
door i'll go to the back all right
all right i'm at his house eleven
o'clock at night nothing weird about
this
i'm just gonna ring his doorbell maybe
he'll give me a house tour
so guys what do you want to do today uh
i don't know dude
who's at the door bruh i don't know this
is your house and we almost had that
scene
o'clock at night it's likely the fans
cannot show up at night
it's the your house though you need to
tell them to go i swear it's fans i'm a
scream
