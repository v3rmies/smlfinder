someone's trying to kill me
but but i'm not home right now i don't
have my house payment marvin
screw your house payment i need you to
open the door right now
someone is trying to kill me but really
you're not lying just to get money open
the door mormon
open the door oh okay okay oh
i have to uh go open the door what
because he's saying he's saying some
weird stuff
look if he tries to come in for the
house payment i'm just gonna run okay
hello marvin where are you down here
oh my god what happened to you get me
inside quick okay
so what happened to you goodman too he's
trying to kill me well he is wow
he threw a pity in the road and he knows
that i'll never hurt money
so i swerved to not hit the pity and i
crashed my ferrari into a tree
you crashed your ferrari yeah but don't
worry cause i had the ferrari insured
for twice for what it's worth
so i'm good there because i'm about to
get paid but i hit my face on the
steering wheel
because i had my airbags taken out to
make the ferrari lighter so it would go
faster
well what happened after you crashed
into the tree i was knocked unconscious
for eight hours
and then i woke up to a pack of wolves
eating my pants
and the only spare pair of pants i had
in my car were my carrot pepper pants
oh well why is goodman two trying to
kill you i don't know
but i need you to figure it out marvin
how am i gonna figure that out
i don't know just figure it out oh no
that might be him at the door you have
to figure this out marvin and i'm gonna
go hide somewhere
in the house i'm gonna answer the door
and figure out what's going on
okay uh hello hey oh goodman too what
are you doing here
i'm just here to see if goodman one is
hiding in your house no
no no goodman's not hiding in my house
you better not be lying to me
goodman too doesn't like liars oh no no
no i'm i'm not lying you can you can
check if you want to
okay i'll do that okay see look there's
no goodman here
hmm are you sure are you sure he's not
hiding in your house somewhere what no
he's not hiding in here baby have you
seen goodman in here
um no not for the past couple minutes oh
really no no no no
she doesn't know what she's talking
about no no no she sees you now she
thinks you're goodman so she thinks
that's what she's talking about hmm
okay that makes sense why are you
looking for goodman anyway i'm gonna
kill him but why
well because if he's dead then i can
take over his company and i can get all
his billions of dollars
that's how i laugh
how about this well since your goodman's
clone why don't you just go to the bank
they're gonna think you're goodman and
you can just take out billions of
dollars and leave
no because i want all this money
well um how about how about no oh
wow really i hadn't thought about that
yeah you're right well how about this
how about if you help me find him you
never have to pay me another house
payment ever again
and i'll give you a million dollars oh
million dollars okay yeah sure i'll do
it i'll do i'll do it marvin no
you could go to jail but it's a million
dollars baby
no my wife
thinks we'll go to jail we're not gonna
go to jail what are they gonna arrest me
for killing my clone i'll just say he
was the evil clone
he's evil not me
yeah yeah just just don't laugh like
that when you say that to them okay
let's go find it oh yeah
uh baby we're we're not gonna go find
him i'm gonna i'm gonna show him the
door so he leaves
marvin i'm literally standing right here
i heard everything that you were saying
uh uh actually we're not gonna what is
that this is my smashing hammer
oh so if you're not gonna go kill him
then why do you need that
uh uh because the front door is jammed
and he's gonna bust the front door down
yeah
sure i'll do that right after i smash
goodman's head with my hands no no no no
no
baby come on guys look at the million
dollars

house payment ever again
i thought we were friends marvin no we
were never friends
you can hit them now i want that million
dollars
but now marvin i'm disappointed in you
hit him harder i'm disappointed in you
too marvin wait
what what no no he's supposed to kill
him give me a million dollars i can't
believe
that you would choose a million dollars
a measly million dollars over our
friendship what
we're not friends oh yeah clearly
but this was all a setup marvin well a
setup yep this is just some guy in a
suit
some kind of yeah clearly it's a guy
that suited your clone no
take your mask off
oh oh man it is hot in there yeah it's
still on your chin ah
yeah gotta hear in my mouth so wait the
guy was you in a suit
yeah he paid me 10 grand to do this but
what okay you need to explain what's
going on
okay so this is what happened so i took
out a two million dollar
insurance policy what in the hell are
you doing it was awesome of the year i
got hope
i got it you good yeah okay can i
continue with my story explain what was
going on
right so i took out a two million dollar
policy an insurance policy on my ferrari
then when i wrecked it
i got paid two million dollars so what i
did was i hired dr finkelshitz
to make a suit that looked just like me
and then i paid him 10 grand to get in
it
once more
continue your story so you put out you
wrecked your ferrari for two million
dollars
yep and then i like i said i had dr
finkelshitz make a suit that looked just
like me
i paid him 10 grand to get in it and
then for fun we decided to see if you
would choose our friendship
over a million dollars which you didn't
oh come on you'd kill me for a million
dollars i would
i wouldn't i i i would i don't know why
i lied i just lied straight to your face
like that
i'm sorry okay so you did so you just
admitted that you get insurance fraud
and aren't you a cop arrest him well i
mean he's gonna give me a cut so i'll
look the other way
well i want some money ah darn it i
guess you're right
i guess the best i can do is two months
with no house payment
and you want some pepper
all right all three together now let's
[Applause]
