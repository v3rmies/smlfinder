i i got
i got a question to ask you and i need
you to be honest okay
am i a good policeman yeah
buddy
what's what's wrong with it
your boss gave your pay to simmons yeah
who's simmons he's my
partner why did your boss give your pay
to your partner
because he saved my boss's purse
and then i found a penny but pennies are
supposed to be good luck
that's what i said that is exactly what
i told him
but my boss my boss is
it's a dork well then well why don't you
just do something to impress your boss
oh okay he's not impressed by pennies
right so like
well okay what you could do is we could
fake a crime
and then you could save that crime and
then you'll be a hero mario that's
dishonest
hold up hold up i think i think you're
something there hold on let me go take
my eyelids off
what all right i'm good you're good yeah
i peeled off my eyelid so i'm fine now
you peeled off your eyelids yeah see
that's how you can tell what emotion i'm
feeling is if i have eyelids and not
because i don't have eyebrows so what
was that plan you had
okay so we fake a really big crime you
save the day and then you'll get the
raise yeah yeah i like that that sounds
good
no that sounds dangerous nobody asked
you
don't you have like laundry or something
to do what's that supposed to mean
well i mean you're always wearing the
same clothes so maybe you did laundry
every now and then you wouldn't stink so
much am i right up top come on
mario if you give him a high five i will
never talk to you again
down low yeah that's my man
my boy right there stop give me a noogie
oh okay okay so
we gotta think about what crime we're
gonna fake oh yeah
you know i always wanted to try to rob
an applebee's and applebee's yeah like
every time i'm in there i'm like
i could take all these appetizers and no
one could stop me no i don't think we
should
do applebee's i think we should do
something bigger what you mean like a
chili's
no no no something big bigger than a
chili's
what like an outback steakhouse no oh no
i'm not doing red lobster that's where i
draw the line no no no
robbing crappy restaurants i'm talking
robbie do something big something huge
what did your partner do that got him
the raise well he uh saved my boss's
wife's purse from a thief oh okay
nothing he helped your boss's wife so we
have to help your boss's wife because
because your boss
loves his wife yeah i mean i don't love
my wife so i don't really see where he's
coming from well most people love their
wife
oh god
[Music]
oh god sit down sit down okay so
so what we can do is um um we could grab
your boss's wife
tie her up right and then and then hold
her for ransom and then you come in and
save her that sounds great i love it
that is
not a great idea you don't love it
you're going to get caught
well yeah that's the whole point i'm
going to catch you yeah i'm supposed to
get caught because
because i'm going to be the guy dressed
up well we're both going to dress up
we're going to grab her
and then he's going to train into his
cop outfit and then he's going to save
the day
no this is not a good idea i'll get away
no one's going to get hurt
it's the perfect plan all right so
that's what we're going to do so let's
go get on like robber outfits but
wait wait where can we find his wife at
oh well she likes to hang out outside
under like a street light and talk about
her purse and how much money she has
it's like her favorite thing to do okay
so we know where she's at so let's go
dress up let's go grab her it's the
perfect idea
you're gonna get this raised yes can't
go wrong oh no
i love just standing outside with me in
my purse get it get it get it
you're all tied up let me go no
what is this about money all right man
what do we do now i'm getting kind of
scared
like we committed a real crime wait no
no no don't be scared look
yes we committed a crime but you're
about to save her so now this is gonna
matter okay you're gonna be a hero
okay yeah you're right okay so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna call your
boss and tell him that we have his wife
and if he doesn't give you a raise he's
never going to see his wife ever again
we can't do that why not then he'll know
that i'm the one that kidnapped her
how would he know that well because why
would anyone else kidnap his wife and
demand that he give
me a raise how would that help anyone
but me oh well
the phone call doesn't matter we just
have to call your boss and let him know
that his wife's missing because he
doesn't know his wife's missing yeah
yeah yeah you're right
okay i'll go get my phone all right
here's my phone all right all right now
call my boss he's in my contact
ooh boss oh i thought it it's ringing
it's ringing hello
gary hey we have your wife yeah we do
yeah if you ever want to see your wife
again
well you're not going to yeah so stop
wanting that because it's not going to
happen

that i'm calling him with well he
doesn't know you're calling but
it's ringing okay okay okay i'm gonna
answer it i'm gonna
apologize i'm gonna explain all this uh
hello all right what was that phone call
about
uh yeah sorry about that sir i was
having an argument with my wife
and uh i said i never wanted to see her

so that's that's what that was
all right just leave your personal
problems to yourself and just focus on
your work

oh she would never do that wait honey
hot honey where are you
okay well i'll just leave you to figure
that out okay we're good i think he
bought it yeah i think you're good

then you're gonna say i'm gonna find her

hello oh god guy my wife is missing i
