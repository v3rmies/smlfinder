cremation is when they burn dead people
oh so it'd be really bad if i went to a

wrong with you oh oh oh this is cool

[Music]
breaking news okay if you have this
rare tom brady action figure still in
the box
and if it has been signed by tom brady
in
mint condition it could be worth up to
two million dollars
there's only one known in existence so
check your closets and basements and you
could be a millionaire
oh my god oops wait junior what did you
just do
i was trying to bend his leg back to
normal that snapped off junior did you
have to see the news
the toy was worth two million dollars
unopened and unbroken or two million
dollars yeah it's the only one like it
in existence and we had it
what if we just put it back in the
packaging and try to sell it what junior
they're gonna know it's broken well you
could just tape his leg back on and the
packaging
it wasn't in bad condition ooh joseph
what did you do with the packaging work
stupid thing work come on come on
huh the packaging i threw it away in the
trash can in the kitchen okay i'll get

spaghetti
oh man yeah i guess that's just gonna
have to do did you tape his light back
on
yeah but junior what is that it's a toy
packaging yeah i can see that why is it
covered in spaghetti oh cause chevy
threw spaghetti in the trash can wait
junior you can't even see tom brady's
signature because it's covered in
marinara well look i tried to clean up
as much as i could
junior no one's gonna pay 2 million for
a box full of spaghetti with tom brady's
name on it
look how about we try to clean up the
case a little bit more put tom brady
back in it and maybe to look good as new
junior i highly doubt that come on
at least try all right cody i put him
back in the packaging and he's good as
new
junior what's wrong there's a piece of
spaghetti on tom brady's face
oh i must have forgot that piece well
yeah yeah you forgot that piece and
obviously tom brady's leg is coming off
oh well you must you should have done a
better job taping it that's your fault
junior we're gonna get like 50 cents for
this you still think we'll get money for
it
no no actually you know what we're not
gonna get anything for this the most we
could do with this is give it to a
homeless person so that they could eat
the spaghetti on tom brady's face
look cody it doesn't look that bad it
looks almost brand new this slightly
it's slightly used okay yes slightly
either i already called the toyota
prisoner so he tells us how much money
it's worth what you already called him
yeah i think it's worth a lot of money
junior i don't want to be here when he
shows up this is embarrassing
that must be him junior i'm leaving when
i get the millions of dollars i'm not
sharing
oh hello there's the toy what

whistle when i find the fault
with the toy well what's the fault it's
brand new it's never been opened
the spaghetti it came like that
i do not recall the 2011 play makers tom
brady toy
coming with a spaghetti accessory well

and i rate this say 12.5
to 2. good day what what's the zachary i
said good day
2.5 hey junior did the toy reviewer come
i
i think so well what'd he say he said
it's a 2.5
out of what i don't know well like 2.5
out of 10 because that would suck he
didn't say
well i guess if it's like a 2.5 out of 5
that'd be okay he just said his zack
rating is a 2.5
who the hell is zach i i think he was
zack he didn't say his name
no wha who is this guy i i don't know
well
can you call him back let me try i've
reached a number that has been
disconnected the number's disconnected
that's weird yeah who is he was he even
real
i don't know but look he says it's a 2.5
so maybe he meant
it's worth 2.5 million dollars i don't
think this is worth 2.5 million dollars
