literally put them in a crate
and ship them to madagascar to be with
the lemurs so they can sing move it
move it there was a fly on the
windshield and guess what happened to
that fly you smushed it no that would
make my car dirty
i was literally like a frog and i went
and i shot my tongue out five feet
i got the fly and i ate it and then when
i pooped it out i lit it on fire
so that's how important that car is to
me marvin well then if it's so important
