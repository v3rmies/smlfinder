i gave him the ticket how much are all
these tickets like how much had to cut
they pay the tickets about ten thousand
dollars ten thousand dollars today
yeah ten thousand dollars we don't have
that money well it's not even the worst
part because since he gets so many
tickets they want me to actually arrest

going back
that police officer can tongue punch my

rob a store but we're gonna do it the
right way okay i wanna wear gloves we're
not going to leave behind any evidence
because i don't want to get caught
we're going to spray paint the cameras
we're going to shut off the alarms we're
not getting caught okay
all right man let's go rob a store
all right jeffy we're going to break in
and the alarm's going to go off your job
is to find the alarm and shut it off
i'm going to spray paint the camera so
they don't have any evidence all right
daddy i don't know what could possibly
go wrong with this idea nothing's gonna
go wrong
all right jeffy turn off the alarm where
do i go check in the back
i have to spray paint this camera
which one shuts off the alarm um i'm
gonna try this one
no not that one no not that one either
i'm gonna try this one
jeffy hurry i'm trying um
maybe this one no this one this one this
one this one
all right daddy good job all right jeffy
i spray painted the cameras and the
alarms off so let's hit the registers
first before we hit the safe all right
daddy
watch these hands go to work oh jeffy
look at all that money
yeah who would have thought daddy look
at us jeffy and mario stealing money out
of the cash register
i don't know i would have thought that
either they just grabbed all the money
oh look at all that money
oh it's just piling up 120 what is this
we're gonna wait a pair of your speeding
tickets and have more money left over
[Applause]

coins all right
let's go let's go to the safe there we
go oh jeffy look how big this safe is
how much money do you think is in there
ten thousand no twenty thousand
no forty i got an inch open don't open

must have taken all their money to the
bank guy what
that's a what a rip-off let me grab it
twenty dollars let's get out of here
jeffy
all right i'm gonna go to jail for this
all right let's see what this alarm's
about
wait is that the car i pulled over
earlier that's probably nothing
all right let's see here what okay the
door's unlocked that's not good this is
definitely a break-in
or maybe the last person just forgot to
lock their door after they got off the
shift oh that makes sense let's take a
look
