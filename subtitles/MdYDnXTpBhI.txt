pull this off you're gonna be a
billionaire yeah i'm going to be a
billionaire
someone's in the house
let me go see oh that's not good that's
not good that's not supposed to be like
that hey a robber hey a homeowner see i
can state obvious facts too well i'ma
call the cops well guess what buddy
hold on i got a big surprise for you
just give me a second this thing is it's
pretty on here
i am a cop hey you you you are caught
with why'd you break into my house cause
i was trying to steal your gold machine
you broke it yeah well now no one gets
it that's what you get for not sharing
well that is it i am going to call you
your chief of police and i'm going to
say that you're a robber and you're
gonna get fired no no no you you don't
have to do that look what if i turn your
sun back to normal huh what about that
you can't turn my sun back to normal
yeah i can because uh gold melts at 2000
degrees so you could just put them in
the oven and then melt them out right
well my oven does not go to 2000 degrees
oh yeah sure it does come on i'll show
you
yeah see we just press bake and it's
already at 350 degrees you can
definitely do 2000 degrees
see
here we go
oh 400 almost at 500. this thing cannot
do 2000 degrees yeah it can look we're
already a quarter of the way there
wait what
oh i guess the highest it can do is 550
degrees i told you it couldn't do 2000
degrees no look it's fine we just put
them in there four times you really
think this oven can melt the gold off my
son's body yeah of course it can
okay i guess i'll just put them in there
hey you get in the oven
you get it a-u
because that's the periodic table symbol
for gold it's a you oh okay i get it i'm
gonna put him in the oven
okay he's in there all right now we just
got to come back in about 10 minutes and
your son's gonna be a-okay okay
all right marvin you ready to see your
son again there's no way this is
actually going to work check it out
with jeffy see i told you it would turn
your son back to normal yeah danny i was
trapped inside charcoal you were trapped
inside chocolate wait look at this
there's little pieces of gold inside the
chocolate i'm so confused why is it
chocolate wait a minute i don't think
that machine turned things into gold i
think it turned things into chocolate
with a gold wrapper on it wait so it
doesn't actually make gold no it just
makes chocolate that looks like gold oh
no
i just paid somebody using that gold oh
well maybe he won't notice
oh no
uh hello
you think this is funny okay goodman
look i did not know the gold was
chocolate and i didn't know i could fit
an entire jar of pickles up my ass but
here we are i don't know good but i
promise it was a big misunderstanding
well fortunately for you i actually like
chocolate and i like it so much and i
thought this was such a funny joke i'll
give you to the end of next week to get
the money wait really yep go ahead
okay
oh thank god
