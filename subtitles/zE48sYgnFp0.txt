what kind of candy do you want

right here in my bucket
whatever here you go oh
yeah look leave okay please now
thank you god not popeye all right guys
who do you think got the most candy dude
it has to be me i got a bunch of candy
no joseph i think i got more well it's
definitely not me because somehow i get
less candy than either of you which
doesn't make sense because we all went
to the same houses well maybe they saw
kin with you so they thought y'all were
sharing a bucket well then i should have
more candy because there's two of us
maybe they knew ken was a dollar you
were just trying to con them out of
candy
well that doesn't explain why some of my
candies aren't even opened and
pre-chewed
like this i don't know if this is a
starburst or cheese i mean it smells
like
it could go either way and i have a
fuzzy lollipop oh dude i like that can i
have that fuzzy lollipop well if you
give me your peanut butter
oh no not the skippy i love me some
skitties look cody they have some candy

junior not everyone with the last name
armstrong has big arms then how they get
that last name their ancestors obviously
had strong arms well
my last name is nut kiss so what does
that say about my ancestors
i mean it's pretty self-explanatory yeah
nut kiss come on cody we know how you

your candy my daddy stole it from me
because you said there was poison in it

jeffy
stupid dog you make me look bad um
all right nighthawk how do we get inside
this pantry door well
popsicle stand i don't really see a
keyhole where he could have locked it so
i think we could probably just open it
no they're adults they're really smart
obviously there's like a child lock on
it or something
well popsicle stand i'm pretty sure we
could just open it with the handle do
you have any c4
c4 yes we could blow the door open what
no no perhaps
no i i actually left my c4 at home well
do you have any land mines a land mine
what would that do we would just put a
land mine down by the door and we'd step
on it and blow the door open and we
would blow ourselves up too
no i don't have a landmine oh nighthawk
i have the perfect way to open this door
okay all right nighthawk
a popsicle stand what are you gonna do
with that cable i'm gonna open this door
with it
well couldn't we just open the door with
the handle no that's too dangerous hold
[Music]
on
[Music]
so we could have just opened it with her
hand no the way i did it was the safe
way okay
okay look cody oh my god junior that's
the holy
grail of candy look how high up it is we
could never reach that high
oh maybe you could throw me up there
yeah with my elephant trunk cause i'm so
strong
yeah sure yeah all right i'm gonna toss
you up there try to grab as much candy
as you can
okay junior when i said i wanted to sit
on your face this isn't what i had in
mind
all right cody i'm gonna toss you in the
air and you try to grab as much candy as
you can okay
okay
come on cody grab the candy i'm trying
junior you need to throw me higher
ow come on cody just grab the candy

we might be tall enough let's try it
okay oh no we're
this isn't doing much yeah it's not
gonna work what if i grab the string and
i try
whipping it with the string no junior
it's not long enough say that again cody
no junior it's not long enough yeah the
long enough part but it's not long
enough yeah
i know something long that we can use
all right cody
we're gonna use this broom it's long
enough yeah junior you're a genius
all right let's get this candy
keep whacking it junior but it's ready
[Applause]
cody your friend has a concussion
what a terrible thing to happen
happen in concussion don't rhyme yes it
does
don't make a fuss or else i'll cuss
and that would be bad for all of us
well how long is he gonna be hurt for he
has brain damage
so someone make me a sandwich sandwich
and damage don't rhyme
i'm doing my best this isn't a test
we were just trying to get candy that
candy is poisonous
didn't you see the nuisances i haven't
seen the news i'll turn it on hold on
[Music]
breaking news okay earlier today
i reported that there was rat poison in
candy and not to eat it
but i'm here to tell you that i misread
the teleprompter
the correct story is that there is candy
in rat poison
so the candy is safe to eat but for the
rats
i hope you like starburst flavor death
well would you look at
that we thought that candy was poison
for a rat
but that poison for a rat was really
candy for a brat
so we could eat candy now you can eat
candy
and this rhyming is getting
exhausting i i'm done with this i'm
going home
you hear that nighthawk we can eat candy
now
hey popsicle stand you might want to
call that doctor back
because uh all peepers here is dunion
rings
