channel where commercials are always
going on and you can see if there's a
restaurant hiring
doesn't that just look delicious we have
the meats
nope nope that's arby's uh hi i'm
brooklyn guy founder and ceo
of burger queen if you're anything like
me you need food to survive
and that's what this is food so if
you're looking to survive and you need
something to eat come on down and get
yourself something at burger queen
also we're hiring so if you're looking
for work and you can keep a secret
come on down and apply oh baby look
burger queen brother queen what kind of
off-brand restaurant is that well they
need some employees so go get hired
i'm not working there well shelby if you
don't buy me a new bib i guess i'm just
got to tell my dad
okay okay god i'll go there
all right welcome to burger queen you
have any questions before we get started
yes how is this different from burger
king that is a great question see i came
up with the original idea for burger
king back in college but then my
roommate overheard me talking about it
he trademarked it before i could
so i had to make burger queen well what
kind of food do you sell
well it is a very complicated and secret
recipe so make sure you don't tell
anyone
all right here's what we do we get in a
car and we go to a burger king then we
buy up all of their food and then we
bring it back here and we tape the
burger queen logo onto the wrapper and
sell it for a dollar more wait isn't
that illegal
oh yeah just make sure you tape the
burger queen logo on real good so it
doesn't come off so we don't get sued
i've already gotten two cease and desist
letters so we cannot get caught again
well what's my job your job is going to
be to take these scissors and cut out
the burger queen logo and tape it onto
these waffles but make sure you don't
call them whoppers
these are called whippers why would
anybody choose burger queen over burger
king
that's probably because of a slogan
which is why eat with a king would you
even go down on a queen
what wait don't don't we serve burgers
yeah it tastes the same
oh there's somebody at the drive-through
window okay i'll stay here and cut out
logos you go take their order
oh okay hey welcome to burger coin how
may i take your order
i don't have a car can i steal the order
here i mean you're here might as well
order oh
well how is this different from burger
king the name
oh what kind of food do you have ah we
have everything burger king has just a
dollar more
really that's a ripoff i know right
what's so
evil that's too evil for me i'm just
gonna go the burger king instead
well smart man goodbye okay i'm done
what do you order i hope it was a
whopper because they're getting cold he
didn't order anything
i told him it was a dollar more than
burger king so he's going to burger king
why would you tell him that what did i
go wrong
you're not supposed to tell him with
stealing food from burger king it's like
you don't even know how copyright
infringement works i didn't tell him we
were stealing food
good and don't tell them the price
either okay we have somebody else at the
drive-through window just
tell them we have two for four of what i
don't know
just sell something okay welcome to
burger king thank you
i mean i mean welcome to burger queen
how may i take your order uh it's just a
drive-through
cause i flew so it's kind of like a fly
through because my cape is kind of like
a car
what do you want oh wait what is this
place burger queen oh i'm sorry i
thought this is burger king no no it's
basically burger king look order
whatever you will order there and we
have it here look we have a two for four
two for four what i don't know okay well
i guess i'll just take two offers then
okay uh two whippers coming up what okay
i need two whippers
two what oh whoppers whoppers right
sorry i forgot the silly things we do
here yeah i got three of them ready okay
and i told them two for four
two for four yes put four or what four
dollars no no no no we can't do that
i got these two for five at burger king
i can't lose a dollar
tell them the two for six the price went
up but you told me two for four
well just tell them tell them it's it's
inflation it's stock stock market and
nasdaq he he won't understand just tell
one okay
look i'm so sorry sir but i have to
change the price it's two for six
but you said it was two for four i know
inflation and stock market and the new
xbox is coming out it's knocking out the
price
oh yeah i guess that makes sense all
right that's fine oh okay thank you sir
okay he said okay he said okay yes
what a jump you know what i'm gonna give
him three but no cause then i'd still
lose money oh okay how about this how
about we tell them three for ten no no
no three foot twenty let's see how much
we can milk this guy for
oh okay then okay sir the new price is
three for twenty but three for twenty i
don't even want three
yeah but the new playstation is coming
out too and the stock market is
depending on that the pre-order's
already sold out
you know okay fine whatever yeah i'll
take it yeah okay okay
he did yes what an idiot i know right oh
should we try to get more
oh yes let's drain this bank account get
get his credit card and i'll write the
numbers down oh what about his social
security number
take it yeah oh high school mascot oh
his first pet's name yeah yeah get that
too
okay okay okay sir i got a brand new
offer for you
i just want my burgers what if i told
you instead of six burgers you could get
three
i thought i was already getting three
but you can get three burgers for a
penny well how's that
possible all i need is your credit card
your date of birth your social security
number and your best name
and your high school mascot huh it seems
kind of fishy
nah okay that nail was good enough for
me
here you go oh platinum i got it i got
it we can buy whatever we want
chef pee pee you're fired wait what that
was a test to see if you'd steal and you
failed we may commit copyright
infringement and steal from burger king
but we never steal from our customers
but you told me to take his car
yeah you should have said no stealing is
wrong because we do not hire criminals
everything you're doing here is a crime
i know
you can keep the store oh my god
where's my food oh there's your food
you're thirsty yeah it's everybody's
weakness
i wonder how chefy's first day at burger
queen went wait where's joseph
oh my god i hate the burger queen oh
chef pee pee did you make 800
to buy me a new bib oh god no i got
fired i think
and then he gave me the store i don't
even know what i'm supposed to do with
that
well you could sell it make some money
oh but i think it's illegal
there's someone at the door wait who's
that i don't know
i guess i'll get it hello hey there it's
me again uh
listen i realized it was pretty
irresponsible of me to just leave you
there with the store like that
yeah yeah because you could tell the
cops what i was doing
so i figured i'd let you buy one thing
with the stolen credit card if you
promised to never tell burger king what
i was doing wait really
are you serious yeah just one thing
though then i need the card back because
i got to buy some stuff too
okay wow chef pee pee thank you for the
new gucci bib
yeah whatever but you better not get
this one dirty okay i won't all right
i'm gonna give this card back to the
burger queen guy
okay here's your quarterback chef pee
pee you're under arrest
why that was also a test to see if you'd
steal you were supposed to say no
stealing is wrong but you gave me the
card well if i gave you the keys to a
car that was going to explode would you
still get in it
no exactly because stealing is wrong now
give me the card back
sucker what cody check out my new gucci
bib
i like you better with it off oh man oh
what's up guys i was in the bathroom
talk about a stomachache p.u so guys
