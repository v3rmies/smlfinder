apple watch oh dude that show
yeah junior that's wait what is that
it's an apple watch
dude that's not an apple watch but you
think it's joseph oh no it's not junior
it has a face
because i have the new apple watch 17 my
dad's close friends are tim cook the ceo
of apple
and he gave us the newest prototype
invention because he wanted me to be
cool well is this the apple watch why is
it sleeping
yeah because the apple watch 17 has a
person built inside it that has emotions
you have to take care of them it's like
a baby
this doesn't exist it does exist because
on my wrist cody you're just lame
because you have the old
apple watch 4 or whatever that one is
this was apple watch 17.
like how many cameras does your apple
watch have none because why would i need
cameras in my watch
because i have two because the new apple
watch has a video camera and cameras i
can take selfie and video and it has 512
megabytes of memory that's way more than
511.
obviously dude he's sleeping joseph shut
up look you woke him up joseph i'm my
story
junior is that a toby what no it's not a
toby what's a toby
you think my dad would embarrass me by
getting me a toby instead of an apple
watch junior that looks like a tote
junior are you friends tell us if you're
totally shut up dad
that's it oh it's not toby okay fine
it's a toby my dad hates me
junior why don't you just buy an apple
watch because i don't have the money to
do that dude we could just go to the
train tracks i'm telling you you can
find a watch
i just i just want an apple watch and i
don't have the money but
i got an idea cody what if you go steal
your mom's purse from her house
and then you take her credit card and
then i can buy an apple watch with it
junior i'm not gonna steal from my mom
just so you can buy an apple watch
but cody she won't notice she doesn't
pay her credit card bills anyway so
she's not gonna notice like
come on cody please junior why would i
do that because you really want me to be
stuck with a toby my whole life
no no one deserves that so please cody
just go steer your mom's purse let's
just do it real quick she'll know
she'll never notice and if we get caught
i'll take full blame for it i'll say i
stole it
okay but we better hurry up because i
don't want to get caught and get
grounded
