all right cody we're gonna start with
you the most famous person you're
related to
is thomas edison whoa no way dude that's
so sick who am i related to
you you're related to neil armstrong
neil armstrong the first man on the moon
i knew i knew a lot about space
whoa an astronaut dude i know it was so
cool okay joseph you're a lady
[Applause]
oh man i always knew i had a dream i
dream every night
no no not quite but close osbourne
dorsey
who's that he's the inventor of the
doorknob oh okay
yeah yeah i'm always good with no
turning doorknobs yep you have fun with
that information oh this is so cool
all right guys can we just admit that
i'm related to the coolest person ever
neil frickin armstrong no edison is
cooler because he invented the light
bulb without him we'd be in the dark
right now
no because if addison wouldn't invented
it somebody else would have been in the
light bulb dude the only way you would
have been able to get inside your house
today is because of my boy dorsey well
no cause then walmart invented those
automatic doors
what yes we don't even need doorknobs we
don't even need him see neil armstrong
he discovered the moon he didn't
discover the moon
junior he just went there yeah and they
say the first person to go on land
discovered that land so he was the first
person on the moon so he discovered the
moon
and he got there with its cool spaceship
he flew there landed he got out
and he danced on the moon dude he
wouldn't be able to get out of his
spaceship without a doorknob well he
wouldn't be able to see the doorknob
without a light bulb
well he he wouldn't be able to go to the
moon if he would have discovered the
moon in the first place dude you used
door nosh for anything
no no you use light bulbs more because
you use them every day oh have you ever
heard of a candle well what what
the whoa whoa the moon lights up the sky
at night so so cause without the moon it
would uh
it would be it would be dark yeah
without light bone no without the moon
you wouldn't even know it was night time
until you open the door no
well no no no you would you wouldn't no
well actually there's windows see bill
gates invented windows so you could look
out the window so we don't even need the
door knob who cares but without door
knobs we wouldn't even have knock knock
jokes huh that's better
well without light bulbs you wouldn't
even be able to see who was at the door
to answer it well without without the
moon you wouldn't know it was night time
so you know not to answer the door
because not scary people come at night
or fans who don't know the rules so
so so that yeah and see without the moon
we wouldn't have waves and without waves
we wouldn't have ships that would bring
you materials to make your stupid light
bulbs and to make your stupid doorknobs
so so actually you know what cody i'm
suing you why i'm suing you
because thomas edison got the idea for a
light bulb by looking at the moon
because he went outside and he said
oh i like that little light in this guy
i want to make one for my own so he made
a light bulb
based on the moon so i'm suing you yeah
i'm suing you too cody because there's
no way mr edison could make
his light bulb without opening a door
from mr dorsey yeah
yeah yeah yeah see so cody you owe
joseph well actually
joseph you owe cody money because
because without the light bulb
dorsey wouldn't have been able to make a
doorknob without light no no no no we
had candles bro we had
oh yeah okay so cody yeah you owe both
of us money but i'm not giving either of
you money well we don't need your stupid
dumb light bulbs cody well okay i'll
just take away all the light bulbs in
your house and see how you like it we
don't need them because we have the moon
to light up everything
nobody's gonna need doorknobs then yeah
we don't need that either because
i just have a door i just push the door
open i don't need a door knob that's
dumb
i like walmart automatic doors lazy
yeah you know what i'm gonna take the
moon away and then what were y'all gonna
do when y'all can't see at night
oh man this is such a huge mess it's
gonna take forever to clean up
wait what happened to the lights oh it
must have been a power outage
