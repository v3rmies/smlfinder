dude why do you sound like that oh i
think i have the
hiccups stop it it's annoying dude dude
stop it i'm gonna punch you in your face
oh yeah i i don't think i can stop it
i'll
try to scare try to scare me if you
scare me they'll go away okay i can do
that it's easy to scare you
oh god really dude come on um try
something else
oh i gotta shut that for you i did
raccoon
raccoon is that a dead raccoon yeah i
found it in the middle of the road
get away from me whatever it'll be my
dinner tonight
dude really you're still hiccuping why
would i be afraid of a dead raccoon
i don't know try to tell me something
scary oh i got something
did you know you swallow a spider every
night while you're asleep
every night yeah every night every night
i swallow a spider yeah dude every night
that's 365 spiders a year yeah that's a
whole lot of spiders but you said
everyone swallows a spider every night
everyone there's seven billion people in
the world so seven billion spiders die
every night dude it's a big problem
why are there so many kamikaze spiders
wanting one that like get eaten hey
don't question these spiders maybe they
want to be
uh m m's or skittles or something i
don't know okay so seven billion spiders
die every night
so that's 2.5 trillion spiders every
year
yeah you're good at math well why are
there so many spiders that want to get
eaten that
that cannot be true joseph grab your
phone and google it i'll grab my phone
hold on
there's no way you eat a spider every
night oh man
uh my bad it's just eight spiders yeah
you only eat eight spiders a year dude

spiders a year
instead of one every night i can live
with that
really that didn't work no it didn't
work the news
breaking news okay 10 time grammy
