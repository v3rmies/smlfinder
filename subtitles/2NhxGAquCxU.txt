so guys today we're gonna fly this kite
oh dude that's gonna be so
fun junior why would we fly a kite uh
cause that's what they're built to do
fly duh have you never flew a kite
before yeah yeah hey joseph joseph why
is that airplane in the sky
i don't know dude i don't know it's like
it was meant to fly or something
i mean i guess a kite can have other
purposes i mean i guess you could use
toilet paper but that'd be uncomfortable
no no junior i mean it's storming
outside so why would we fly a kite
is it against the rules to fly a kite
during the storm no it's just a bad idea
well why
there's so much wind during the storm i
think it'd be a good idea to fly a kite
during wind yeah you know i think kites
only work with wind cody cody you're so
dumb
you know what else there is in a store
what lightning i know i know that's why
i put a key right here so we can
discover electricity
it's already been discovered duh i know
that cody i'm not stupid how do you
think there's light down in the house i
know there's electricity i just want to
discover it again
if it's already been discovered why
would you try to discover it again
because the first caveman that made a
fire does that mean that we can't make
any more fires
what yeah oh you're stupid so let's go
fly this kite outside
idea all right guys are you ready to fly
this kite dude it's going to go
so high yeah they go over the trees like
this is a bad idea guys
no it's not we're going to get struck by
lightning because you taped a key to the
top of the kite we're gonna discover
electricity like benjamin button you
mean benjamin franklin who already
discovered it benjamin franklin
discovered the hundred dollar bill
that's why he's on it
duh dude they're so hard to find yeah
all right sorry guys so on the count of
three we're gonna release the kite in
the air okay okay
three two one
oh guys what happened get struck by
lightning you idiot
oh there's so much pain oh it hurts
oh guys let's go back to my house
cody i don't feel good yeah of course
not because we get struck by lightning
because you're an idiot and wanted to
fly a kite during a thunderstorm why
didn't you try to talk me out of it i
did
oh are we gonna die i don't think so
we're pretty lucky actually
only one out of 1.2 million people get
struck by lightning and six thousand of
those die
so what you're saying is we should buy a
lottery ticket because we're so lucky
yeah maybe
oh dude i don't feel too good me either
yeah i feel really thirsty i wish i had
a bottle of water
cody am i a bottle of water yeah you're
a bottle of water dude that's crazy well
how's that even possible
i don't know i was just thinking about a
bottle of water and i turned into a
bottle of water
what uh joseph what dude do you think we
got struck by lightning it gave cody
superpowers no way that'd be crazy dude
that'd be insane well maybe yeah i guess
it's possible oh my god
those are like can you like morph into
anything i don't know maybe just a
bottle of water that would suck
oh you should try to morph in something
else like uh you should morph into a
computer mouse
okay let me try it hey guys i'm a
computer mouse cody's a computer mouse
whoa dude that's crazy you really can't
morph into anything

into your shelf though yeah oh i hope so
i don't want to be a computer mouse
forever here we go
okay guys do i look like me oh no joseph
