to learn roy's rules what are roy's
rules
roy's rules are the roles you have to
live by to be as cool as roy i want to
learn roy's rules i want to learn
okay so the first rule you probably
already know never pay for
anything anything anything ever wait how
do i get stuff then
people will just buy stuff for you
because you're roy that's so awesome
yeah people will buy you like super bowl
tickets and nice restaurants and stuff
like that just because you're roy that's
the coolest thing ever hey give me 20
bucks
sure thing roy here's 20 bucks what are
you doing giving you money cause you
asked for it why are you giving anyone
anything you're raw
you get things you don't give things
you're right i'm roy people should be
giving me money yeah exactly
okay now rule number two is hard to get
if you want to get hard you got to play
hard to get wait is that why your last
name is get hard that's exactly why my
last name is get hard well how do i play
hard to get well whenever
a girl likes you you just pretend not to
like her back um let me try
hey babe get in here hi this guy's name

see she wants me now cause i don't like
her that's so awesome did you write that
down joseph dude i'm writing it down now
oh that's so awesome you're so cool roy
okay now
rule number three steal other people's
girls
even if they're in a happy relationship
especially if they're in a happy
relationship because that relationship
isn't happy because they're not with roy
oh why don't we just go after single
girls well because they're single for a
reason
right that means other people don't want
them that's why you have to go after
girls who are already in relationships
those are the good ones oh you're right
oh roy's so smart yeah he's smart dude
that's why he's cool
okay we'll do that okay so roll number
four is yolo
you only live once okay so do whatever
you want like get married
have kids get divorced don't take care
of the kids do whatever you want to do
because you're roy
live a full life live a full life and do
whatever you want as much as you want so
how many times can i do that oh you can
do it forever
that brings me to rule number five
repeat you do all of this
over and over again until you die but
the most important
thing is rule number one never pay for
anything
like especially super bowls especially
super bowl okay oh my gosh so never pay
play hard to get steal people's girls
yolo and repeat
yeah okay so you guys should memorize
this and then we'll go out into the
battlefield and try to find some girls
