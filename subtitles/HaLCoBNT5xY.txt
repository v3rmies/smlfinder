you win to win an ipad
i don't know what do you mean you don't
know a random package came to my door
and it had an ipad in it well then you
didn't win a contest how do you know
because you have to enter a contest to
win a contest
maybe i won the most not entered contest
contest if you didn't enter a contest
then how would they know who to send the
ipad to
they checked the database and they said
