world last night and i want to imitate
it dude what was it
up up oh like the pixar movie yeah this
old guy he like wants his house to fly
so he ties a bunch of balloons to his
house and his house actually flies so i
want my house to fly look you can't
really do that junior that was just a
movie
yeah i can balloons make stuff go in the
air so if i put enough balloons on my
house it'll go in the air
well maybe but it would take like
millions of balloons so we're just gonna
get millions of balloons well how are
you gonna get millions of balloons can
you buy it
yeah what an idiot like he's so dumb he
actually doesn't know what money is dude
he's like only two shits for balloons
yeah so it's like only like 20 bucks
he's supposed to be the smart one i know
junior just because you see something in
a movie doesn't mean you can really do
it
it happened in a movie codes that mean
they can really happen they don't make
movies about stuff that doesn't happen
yes they do they do it all the time like
what about star wars that actually
happened it happened a long time ago in
a galaxy far far away they even tell you
in the beginning cody it's history
okay fine so look you're telling me that
every pixar movie didn't actually happen
so you're telling me that there's like
ratatouille there's not a restaurant in
france that's like ran by rats
yeah no that did not happen so monsters
don't come out of your closet to collect
your screens yeah
that that happens but no it doesn't oh

uncle comes out of my closet to collect

all going to laugh at you so we give
them a bunch of energy oh yeah
all right say hi to mike wazowski
i told you oh great they shredded our
door
or there were no monsters in there to
begin with no they heard about our plan
that we were going to expose them so
they shredded our door because they
didn't want us to find out
the monster world oh dude i hate when
that happens well cody why would you do
this
whatever wow guys i can't believe i'll
never see mike wazowski do stand up in
my room ever again because they shredded
my door but again

jokes anyway back to what i was saying i
want to blow up a bunch of balloons so
my house can fly i want to go to space
junior there's not enough balloons in
the world to send your house to space
i have a bunch of balloons downstairs
cody and we're going to blow up some
balloons and prove you wrong
yet again again you didn't prove me
wrong about the monsters
oh this is gonna take forever joseph how
many balloons have you blown up only one
dude
i'm getting lightheaded me too junior
this isn't gonna work you don't have the
right kind of balloons what are you
talking about you need helium balloons
these are rubber balloons
no junior helium is what goes inside the
balloons it's a gas
oh joseph we're supposed to be farting
in the balloons start farting in them oh
i can do that
you don't fart in the balloon you have
to mine for helium
you have to mine for it yes you're mine
helium
you're mine yeah you gotta want it
you're mine blame it oh my god come here

helium in the earth
why because it comes out of rocks oh we
have to collect rock farts
joseph do you still have dwayne the rock
johnson's number no i lost it dude
we could really use this farts right now
i know all right so we can just go buy
helium balloons right well
i mean yeah come on joseph we're gonna
buy some balloons okay junior
all right cody we bought a bunch of
helium balloons you bought three
well the guy in the movie used regular
balloons these have characters on them
so they're more powerful
what the minions made so much money in
the box office how much weight that is
to carry what junior it doesn't matter
they can't lift your house yes they can
well they're not even lifting your couch
so why would they lift your house
what do you want to do cody i want you
to accept that your house is not gonna
fly yes it's gonna fly well i want to go
to space
who are we gonna talk to to help get my
house go to space dude call elon musk
you'll know oh yeah
but you still know his number oh no i
forgot joseph always forgets phone
numbers
ooh i'm so stupid what dude why don't we
just call some aliens to lift our house
with a ufo
dude that's genius junior you just know
aliens that you could just call yeah
let's go outside i know how to call him
what junior how are you going to call an
alien like this
junior what was that it's an alien phone
call ring what really because it sounds
like a turkey
wakka wakka wakka okay that sounds like
pac-man dude look oh
what
you've got to be kidding me all right
guys get some house inside the house
okay
whoa the house is getting lifted up guys
i think the balloons are helping
no junior i'm pretty sure it's the
aliens with their ufo
no the blood would definitely help me a
little bit
guys we're in space dude this is so cool
how are we breathing okay guys guys
what's going on we're in space
yeah yeah i noticed see i i was using
your bathroom because i do that
sometimes i like to just sneak into your
house and use a bathroom because i don't
like using gas stations
and then when i tried to leave i noticed
we were in outer space yeah i got aliens
to take my house to space
oh okay cool uh do you know when they're
gonna bring us back down the earth
i don't know i gotta talk to them oh
okay well i mean
that's fine i just i left my car running
so i don't want it to run out of gas
and i was also on the phone with my wife
and i told her hold on so
she's probably going to be on hold for a
while and she's always wanted to go to
space together
so if i tell her everyone without her
she'd be pretty mad oh well
i'll try to talk to him but i guess
we'll be in space for a little bit okay
all right that's that's fine i'll uh i i
guess i'll just walk walk around
yeah oh charlie
you are so hilarious wait what are you
doing in here
i told you to get out of here you know
watching charlie and friends wait
what are you doing with that knife huh
i wonder what's in this room i mean it's
not my house but i'm still curious
all right cody now that we're in space
can we go outside like float around
no junior there's no oxygen outside
what's oxygen
it's what we breathe junior i thought we
breathe helium
junior you're so stupid guys guys guys i
just found a body
what what what's that mean well it means
somebody in this house
is an impostor or a murderer i mean that
that's really a better term for what
they're doing they're not really
impersonating anybody
or someone in here is impersonating
someone that's not a bad person
yeah yeah i guess you could say that
sure yeah where'd you find the body it
was in your dad's room
my dad's room well we were all here yeah
we were here dude yeah so
you're the one who did it because you
were the one that found it no i'm a cop
i wouldn't do that
i mean he has a copy is pretty nice well
was he unarmed yeah well
yeah awesome yeah totally such it's us
come on why would i do that
guys i think we should skip because we
don't really have any like you know
proof so i think we should skip this
round and just see if we have any like
evidence next round
i guess so dude let's go all right you
get away with this one okay

the house and try to find some more

from the kitchen and you weren't in
there i mean i i came up here as soon as
he called the meeting that's that's what
it was no i only called the meeting and
i saw you come out the vent why would i
call a meeting just for no reason

saw him come in the vent but how could
you do that if you were just coming from
the kitchen
uh uh i was coming up uh the stairs and
i saw him coming out of the vent with a
knife

call a meeting if i was gonna tell
