ding ding ding ding ding congratulations
daddy
you're now on the jeffy game show and if
you answer this one question correctly
then you have to buy me the new
playstation 5 and the new xbox series x
i don't want to play well too bad daddy
the first question is
what color is my helmet red
[Music]
ding ding ding ding ding that is correct
no
you just changed your helmet mario you
said he had a red helmet on now he's
wearing a red helmet well no it was blue
and he just changed it doesn't count
well danny i don't make the rules i just
follow him well i'm not buying you the
new playstation or a new xbox just wait
till christmas
christmas that's like next month i don't
even know if i'll be alive by then
you'll be alive next month i know mario
that's true
the sun could explode tomorrow yeah and
if the sun explodes then i don't know
what it's like to have a playstation 5
or a brand new xbox well no one will
know because if the sun explodes we'll
all be dead so no one will care look
jeffy look christmas is next month and
you have to be good
because santa claus is watching oh santa
claus watching
well what about this santa claus i got a
big diaper full of jeffy jeffy that's it
you're grounded grounded
what did i do mario how about we make
him a good boy chart
what's a good boy chart here look every
time jeffy does something good we put a
gold star on the chart and when he has
25 gold stars he gets a prize
good idea baby he'll never do 25 good
things so he'll never get a prize mario
that's not the point
jeffy look uh we got you a good boy
chart good morning
yeah good boy chart if you do 25 good
things i'll buy you
one of the new systems 25 good
things i might as well just wait till
christmas then wait till christmas well
no daddy tell me what the 25 good things
are okay you have to do good things like
you can't be annoying you can't poop
your pants and uh you can't break stuff
well i haven't broken anything all day
so gold star
oh go get the gold stars no all right
jeffy there's your first gold star
i got a star daddy that is the tits
and you lost your gold star i lost it
what did i do
you said a bad word that's a bad word
most people would say it's a good word
jeffy look you can't say bad things you
can't do bad things you can only do good
things to get gold stars well
daddy my butt's mad at you you better
gotta listen to what he's gotta say
jeffy that is disgusting look you can
only do good things so start doing good
things okay well what good things do you
want me to do then dang
one take the microphone out of your
pants
okay next go clean the entire kitchen
and you'll get a gold star all right
well this might actually be a good thing
he starts doing good stuff
yo yo yo mario what's up folks what's up
black yoshi yeah man i know you see that
new play david five you know the ps4
yeah i saw it in the new xbox
yeah well my pockets run a little thin
this month so i was wondering if you'd
be done slamming that though
so i can get the consoles i don't have a
thowie owie look like
i'm not gonna buy you any of the systems
because i have to buy jeffy one if he
finishes a good boy chart
good boy chops what's that about folk
well if jeffy gets 25 gold stars i told
my buying one of the systems
well why don't i get some good more chop
because you just don't get one
well hold up vote
[Laughter]
mario take this out right here this is
my own good boy chops
and instead of 25 stars i got 50 stars
on there
like the american flag i'll play the
libra
do the good boy chops to the united
states or give me both the consoles
black yoshi what
good things have you done uh i'll be
done check the mail
that's what my mail was stolen oh yeah
your grandmother sent you five dollars
for your birthday
but i already been on spencer like
that's a federal offense mario i don't
care what type of film it
is if it's a picket fence a huckleberry
fence the miami dolphins look you're not
getting any of the systems i don't care
if you have a good boy chart
well fine then folk you green i'm just
going to take my chalk somewhere else
maybe i'll take it to walmart and they
can see how good i've been
and maybe they just give me the cars for
free oh
man i don't want to clean all these
dishes hey jeffy what are you doing i'm
about to have to clean the kitchen so i
can get a gold star
what happens if you get a gold star well
i get to get all the new systems
really yeah we want to see my new toy
that i just got heck yeah
junior all right turn off all the lights
all right all right jeffy
check this out it's a lightsaber
junior that is the tits i know right
it's a real lightsaber show if i touch
it my fingers are going to come off
yeah the wire you must be
made out of armor or something yeah yeah
maybe i am the bfd with the bfd
yeah so what if instead of cleaning
those dishes you got rid of those dishes
like a sieve
oh heck yeah junior heck yeah here use
your jedi powers to clean those dishes
all right jeffy the dishes are all lined
up for you
dishes i am your father
[Music]
[Applause]
you showed those dishes i sure did
junior
whoa jeffy look at the big mess you made
i know junior
show [ __ ] oh you made a big ole mess now
i'ma go tell your daddy
oh please don't go tell my daddy i'm
supposed to be being a good boy
and get the gold star so i can get the
new systems well
if you help me get the new playstation 5
then
uh i won't tell you all day that you
made a big ole mess so this is what the
plan gonna be
so what you gonna do is you wanna go
steal the gold stars
and put it all over your good boy card
and then you're gonna take that card to
your mama
will tell your mama that your daddy gave
you the stars and then she gonna buy you
the xbox
then you take that same card and take it
to your daddy
and then you tell your daddy that your
mama gave you the stars and then he
gonna buy you the playstation and then
you get playstation to me oh that idea
sounds pee-pee
well when do i get a system you don't uh
all right so
go steal the stall and get a car to your
mom all right

hungry oh me too

always gonna give you one star for
cleaning the kitchen
well now you gotta go get me my
playstation well jeffy don't explain me
what each star was for
all right well the first star because i
cleaned one dish
then i cleaned two dishes and then i
cleaned three dishes
and now i clean four dishes no you don't
not clean
five dishes you don't get a star
purchase all the way down to 25 dishes
oh you know what jeffy fine listen i
will go ahead and buy you one game
system but only one
but on christmas morning when you wake

jeffy i have your xbox oh
mother that is the bosoms thank you for
being such a good boy jeffy
oh i'm the bestest boy ever enjoy
no no no this ain't right what's wrong
they went ahead and got us the digital
dishes or the ps5 and xbox so they went
cheap on us
is that bad yeah it's bad because what
happens if our wi-fi goes out then we
can't access our games so we need the
ones with this
dishes so what we need to do is i got
some playing
we're gonna go downstairs and we're
gonna break both of these consoles
so they have to take it back and get us
the better ones so come on let's go
all right jeffy so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna break them and then
you'll take them back to your parents
and tell them that they came like that
then they're gonna take them back to the
stove
and then they're gonna exchange them for
the ghouls all right all right so i'm
gonna hit the egg bot with the hammer
are you ready here we go
maybe that ain't working i got an even
better idea
all right folks we're gonna throw the
xbox out the balcony here we go
all right let me get the playstation all
right right here
playstation 5 is nick
let's go check it out folks oh oh yeah
folk
they broke it so now what you gotta do
is you gotta take them your parents
and tell them they came like this all
