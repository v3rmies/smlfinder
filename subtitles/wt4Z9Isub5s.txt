my chicken quesadilla is finished
and it smells delicious
uh hello junior i am so screwed what's
wrong richard
well my dad is at his massage
appointment and he told me to stay in my
room because i was grounded
because i ran up a hundred thousand
dollars on the credit card buying v
bucks for fortnight so i'm in my room
and i'm like hmm
what would be a good idea i'm gonna go
joyriding in my dad's brand new car
and i wrecked it junior i ran into a
tree he ran into a tree
yeah and i need you to come look at the
damage and tell me if you think my dad's
gonna notice
okay all right all right junior i'm not
even gonna show you where the dent is i
just wanna see if you notice it
okay so uh do you see it is it right
there
damn it that noticeable huh yeah i mean
it's really big
well the only thing that i got going for
me right now is that my dad is old
so maybe his eyesight isn't as good as
ours yeah yeah
we're young so that's why we notice it
oh darn it i just remembered my dad got
lasik
twice why'd he get it twice well the
first time he got it
he was dating his wife and he thought
that she was ugly so he thought his eyes
were bad
so he went and got lasik so then he
still thought that his wife was ugly
so he got lasik again and then he just
realized that she was just
ugly and so he divorced her so she ended
up being my mom so
oh what does bmw mean oh bmw stands for
big mexican women
which is what i'm trying to pick up with
my bmw here and take them back to my la
hacienda
you know i like my women how i like my
tacos full of sour cream
well how'd you hit a tree well let me
tell you junior i was driving along
picture this driving along clear road
and all of a sudden
boom tree and i hit it and it ran off
the tree ran off yeah and so i think we
should follow a police report
saying that it was a hit and run because
the tree ran off and i didn't even get
his insurance information that's a good
idea because if it's a tree's fault then
your dad won't get mad at you exactly
let's call the police
hey there somebody call the cops oh big
mexican women right
nice all right why'd you call me so
there's a den on my car
and i'm not going to show you where it
is i just want to see if you notice it
well yeah i can see it it's right there
damn it that noticeable huh i mean yeah
it's pretty obvious did you get lasik
recently no it's just a big old den
what happened well this is what happened
officer picture this
i was driving my dad's car and all of a
sudden
a tree jumped down the middle of the
road and i hit it and then he ran off
and i didn't collect his insurance
information okay okay wait wait wait
hold on i have several questions
first off how old are you 12. okay you
should not have been driving a car you
don't have your driver's license
actually i'm 16. huh actually you know
now that i think about it you are 16.
you do have a driver's license
congratulations
thank you so what happened so i was
driving along
a tree jumped out in the middle of the
road and i hit it and it ran off
well trees don't usually just jump out
into the road like that
well this one did was it groot from like
from guardians of the galaxy
no yes actually yes it was him let's go
arrest him he did it well he's not
actually on this planet as far as i know
so i don't think that was him but you
know i am a mechanic so i could probably
take care of that for you
okay that'd be great all right let me go
get my overalls on he could probably fix
it
yeah all right i'm back is that a toilet
plunger no this is the suck-o-matic 5000
it has 5000 pounds of suckage this thing
could suck anything i'd leave my wife
for this thing would talk less
well could it get the dent out i can't
it get the den out of course it'll get
the den out this thing will look good as
new just check this out

chives insisted dad
so i was driving along and i hit a tree
and then i brought it straight back to
junior's house
to try to fix it so i wouldn't get in
trouble for what chives
told me to do and that's when that's
when
this crazy guy came and hit the car with
a hammer and you'll see that on your
