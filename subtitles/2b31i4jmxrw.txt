a kid it must be a mistake from the bank
but i have ten thousand dollars i mean
it's the bank's money you're just
borrowing it look but i can spend ten
thousand dollars you have to pay it back
junior what so why you gonna spend two
thousand dollars or whatever i want
no no no you're a kid you shouldn't even
have that card give it to me let me cut
it up no you're not gonna cut it up like
the bank obviously thinks i'm a big boy
and that i deserve to have a credit card
chef pee pee junior you're not
responsible give me that card i'm gonna
cut it up you shouldn't even spend it

ten thousand dollar credit card well i'm
