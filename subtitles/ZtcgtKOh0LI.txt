down
the fifth number is 43.
oh 43 pointy we got five numbers
the final number the number that will
get you to win 150 million dollars
is 13. 13.
we just 150 million dollars
well actually it's 94 and a half million
dollars after taxes but that's still a
lot of money we can retire
what are we gonna do with all that money
we should get some charities no
screw charity they already got their
money we should spend this on us
yeah yeah we should buy a yacht with a
swimming pool on it and then i could buy
a jet ski and ride my jet ski in the
pool on my yacht
i could buy one of two chainz's chains
and then you'd have to change his rap
name to one chain
and then i could be one chain oh my god
we could buy an 80 bedroom mansion and
then sleep in a different bedroom every
night but boy
don't you want to just get a nice little
house in the mountains and just be
together
ew no of course i don't want that no i
want my 80 bedroom mansion
oh my god we have to pay so many maids
to clean all those rooms
oh but they could all be naked and then
i could pay them to all make out with
each other
but boy what about just us yeah yeah
yeah you're right we should get an
island but not like a really really big
island because we're not billionaires no
just like a normal regular sized island
yeah and then i could hang out on my
island with all my maids while they make
out with each other naked doesn't that
sound fun karen
karen karen where'd you go with the
lottery ticket karen
no no no no karen what are you doing my
maids no karen what are you doing
i hate how you're planning on spending
the money i think this money would have
ruined our lives
ruined our lives did you not hear the
part about the 80 naked maids that would
have been a good thing
boingy how did you have the horror
stories of people winning the lottery
that run with their lives
well yeah but those people didn't spend
that money on 80 naked maids in an
island
that that would have made them happy i
think i did the right thing
no no i want my island in my yacht and
my jet ski
now we can't even get one naked maid
pointy i'll be a naked maid
ew all we need is all love oh i don't
want love i want maids
[Music]
breaking news mkay the winning ticket
for the 150 million dollar lottery
was sold in our town and is still
unclaimed
so make sure you check your tickets oh
oh would you look at that the ticket
still hasn't been claimed
i wonder why somebody wouldn't claim a
winning lottery ticket
maybe it's because this stupid ugly wife
shredded it
all we need is our love boy i need
dinner's freddy
this is my dinner boy you can't have
beer for dinner why
it'll kill me slower than your cooking
will boingy i worked really hard all day
on this dinner for you
you wouldn't have to cook at all if we
had 80 naked
maids to cook for us boyney that's 80
naked maids not 80 naked cooks
well we could we could buy some that
could cook you know and they could make
out
naked while they cooked it would be
dinner in a show
boitie wash your hands and get ready for
dinner
i'm going to kill her i'm i'm no yep yep
yep i'm going to kill her i'm going to
kill how do i kill her though
poison yep yeah it'll be poison i'll put
it in a food
and then nobody will think it's poison
they'll just think she died from eating
her crappy food because it's always bad
hey there what can i get you poison to
kill my wife and i don't want them to be
able to trace it back to me
oh all right i think i got just the
thing there you go
it's called drop dead you put some of
that in your wife's food
and she'll drop dead no trace perfect
burned lasagna look i put pink lemonade
in a wine glass because i want to feel
fancy
you could have had real wine at the top
of the eiffel tower
and eating lasagna cooked by the rat
from ratatouille
his name was remy i don't care what his
name is with all that money we could
have bought in the rights to ratatouille
and changed his name to lasagna okay now
you're just being silly eat your dinner
it's burned it's slightly overcooked
slightly that's like saying the titanic
is slightly underwater pointy eat your
lasagna
it's stinky what the lasagna is stinky
you cooked stinky lasagna
boingy i know you use hurtful words as a
weapon but you don't have to be rude

because it's stinky and i think it's
trying to kill me well
put some ketchup on it or something oh
