my phone's ringing rosalina what does
she want
i just ran over jeffy i just ran over
jeffy
oh
and i'm gonna say someone else hit him
yeah i'm gonna say someone else hit him
come on jeffy come on you're okay oh
baby it's so awful
mario why didn't you answer my call uh
because i was driving and i don't look
at my phone while i'm driving that'd be
responsible you could hit someone were
you with another woman what no look at
me
someone hit jeffy with their car ran off
what oh no my poor
baby mario what happened i was i was
pulling into the driveway
and you started calling me and then i
looked up and some crazy maniac who was
on his phone
uh hit jeffy and drove off who would do
this i don't know some some crazy guy
but it was an accident but uh so we
shouldn't call it cops we should just
call a doctor
mario did you see what the car looked
like oh he was driving uh
a red car mario you drive a red car
yeah yeah a lot of people drive red cars
but there was it was some guy
driving a red car he hit jeffy and he
drove off did you see what he looked
like
no his uh his phone was blocking his
face so i didn't see him but we should
definitely call a doctor because
not the cops because we shouldn't get
the cops involved it was an accident
mario we need to call the cops
no we should call a doctor jeffy's
obviously hurt we have to call a doctor
but mario the person who did this
deserves to go to jail for the rest of
his life
wait really yes it was an accident
though mario we have to call the cops
right now oh no we gotta call a doctor
no mario the cops the doctor cops a
doctor
haley somebody called doctor cop yes dr
cop somebody hit my son with their car
and drove off and we didn't know whether
to call a doctor or a cop
well he is injured so i could see what
you'd want to call a doctor and he was
in a hit and run which is illegal so i
could see what you'd want to call a cop
so i'll just be both and fix all of it
okay thank you so much all right let's
see if your son's okay
oh he's got a pulse so he's alive that's
good oh thank god
thank god i thought i killed him i mean
i thought i thought the guy driving the
car who hit him and ran killed him
that was weird it was weird what you
just said i'm gonna remember that that
was weird all right let's see if your
son's responsive hey
hey kid wake up hey hey i'm gonna bite
you here i'm gonna do
all right see if somebody was biting my
ear i'd wake up so i'm gonna say
he's in a coma baby
oh no a coma oh no yeah i mean i'm gonna
be honest i'm just kind of eyeballing it
but we're gonna go with coma for now
until he wakes up okay
okay so about that hit and run we don't
have to worry about the hit and run the
guy's long gone by now and he'll learn
his lesson one day karma will get him
no he committed a crime and he's going
to jail for a long long long long long
time a long
long long time oh a long long long long
long long time how long is a long
long time like 30 years for 30 years
i'll be like 70. i mean i mean uh
okay so yeah yeah let's figure out who
that is if we ever find him yeah if we
ever find him tell me what happened
okay so my son was riding a horse on the
road and then the car hit him
i'm sorry your son was riding a horse
yeah but my son was riding a horse in
the road and a car hit him and drove off
so the horse got hit by the car too yes
is the horse okay should i be getting my
vet
outfit oh no the horse wasn't real oh it
was an imaginary horse no no no
the horse is a thing it just wasn't real
i'm sorry is the horse alive and dead no
it's
it's dead it's never been alive okay so
your son was riding a stillborn horse no
no no
no no no it's like an adult horse your
son was riding a dead adult horse
i mean yes i mean the horse has never
been alive so it's like a dead adult
horse oh my gosh it was a stuffed horse
oh why didn't you just say that well
because it is a stuffed horse but it
also is like a machine
it has like this bouncy mechanism i
don't care i don't care about the horse
why are you talking
to me about a horse because you asked
what happened he was riding the bouncy
stuffed horse i don't care about the
horse okay tell me about the car what
did the car look like it was
it was a red car and it was going super
fast and it hit it hit them and it drove
off
okay okay so where's the horse what the
the horse i don't know you said you
didn't care about the horse i mean
you're right but
the horse like it's in the road there
might be pieces of it in the grill of
the car
okay okay red horse car i can work with
that who was driving red horse car there
was some guy i didn't see him he had he
had a phone in front of his face
okay okay he has a phone what else did
he look like i mean i didn't really see
much i think he had a mustache a
mustache
okay what color was the mustache uh uh
uh orange brown orange oh no it it
wasn't me was it
no no i mean you can tell me if it's me
i can handle the truth i'll arrest
myself it's okay i i mean
it could be you i don't know hmm i feel
like i'd remember hitting a dead adult
horse
hmm hey yeah no i don't think it was me
[Music]
it wasn't me you know you know that song
it's like shaggy yeah i know that song
but okay so yeah
yeah so it wasn't you it was just some
random guy with a mustache
random guy in a horse car with a
mustache owns a phone
okay okay i think that's enough to go on
uh i'm going to track this guy down but
man i really wish his son would wake up
so he can tell me who hit him wait
wait wait wait wait wait do you think my
son will remember who hit him i mean
he's wearing a helmet so yeah probably
when he wakes up how can i make him not
remember okay that was another weird one
i'm gonna remember that too you
you're being weird i'm gonna keep my eye
on you you're weird mario when do you
think jeffy's going to wake up
hopefully not anytime soon mario why
would you say that uh because you know
he's
hit by a car so i bet he's in a lot of
pain and i'd rather him being a coma so
he doesn't feel the pain wait a second
mario we have cameras outside what if
the cameras caught the guy who hit jeffy
yeah you're white we do have cameras
outside well let's go check no no no no
no no i
i will go check the cameras you should
stay here and make sure jeffy keeps
breathing
okay mario yeah you stay here don't
follow me
what you doing buddy uh
destroying my security camera yeah i can
see that i guess i was mostly just
wondering why
oh because uh don't tell my wife but
earlier i made out with the ice cream
man and the camera caught it and i
didn't want her to see it oh who hasn't
been there right yeah i just wanted free
ice cream i didn't have any money so i
made out with the ice cream man yeah
what kind of ice cream you get
uh the spongebob with the messed up eyes
oh yeah yeah that's worth making out
with an ice cream man
you uh sure you're not destroying that
because it saw you doing something
illegal no
no it's america can a man destroy his
own security camera so his wife hasn't
seen him make out with ice cream man
yeah yeah i guess you can do that but uh
you're not doing a very good job light's
still on
oh it's still working we could fix that
yeah i i would actually stop doing that
if i were you oh well uh did you uh did
you find the red horsey car
no no not yet but i am still on the
lookout for a red horse car
being driven by a guy with a mustache
who isn't me and owns a phone what
who's that
now that looks like a red horsey car
excuse me sir is this your car
yeah i'm driving it are you blind
has a mustache i do hold on
wha look there's a horse emblem on the
car red horsey car
yeah red horsey car oh i think this
might be the guy excuse me sir do you
own a cell phone
yes what's with all the dumb questions
okay i think this might be our guy hold
on let's check the grill and see if
there's a horse stuck in it
what all right let's check the grill
oh man do you see what i see a horse
yeah there's a horse in the grill of his
car i think this might be our man hold
on let's check the facts
he has a mustache he drives a red horsey
car there's a horse in the grill of his
car and he owns a phone
he also came back to the scene of the
crime which most criminals do i think
this might be our guy
the only question now is does this look
like the car that hit your son
uh yes yes definitely this is the car
definitely oh yeah it looks just like it
okay i'm gonna go arrest them this
is effing ridiculous excuse me sir step
out of the car please
why because you're under arrest for a
hit and run i didn't hit anybody you
telling me you didn't hit a kid on a
horse
today no i didn't hit yankee doodle
coming to town while i was driving my
ferrari
yeah well we have a witness who saw you
hit a kid who was riding a horse
but i didn't hit anybody then what are
you doing here
i came here to get mario's house payment
oh yeah that's a very likely story but
look we have a witness
who saw you in your horsey car hit a kid
and maybe a horse i'm i'm not really
sure if the horse was there or if the
horse was real or dead or imaginary but
but look you're under arrest
well i'm gonna be calling my lawyer okay
but
let me arrest you first we'll figure
that out later oh fine
hey baby they found the guy that ran
over jeffy they did who did it
it was mr goodman oh my gosh well i'm
glad he's finally behind bars poor jeffy
yeah or poor jeffy but finally justice
was served
yeah he's finally locked up and since i
solved the crime i guess i don't need
this hat anymore
daddy why'd you run me over with your
car
hold on i'm getting it
what oh jeffy what are you talking about
you ran me over with your car when you
were playing on your
phone oh no no he doesn't always talk
about the jeffy i think you noodled your
caboodle oh you uh
you you uh you knocked you something
happened to your head
it wasn't me it wasn't you no it wasn't
me jeffy was it me
yes it was i saw you driving the car
with your phone in front of your face
i said daddy stop and you improve you
hit me
you know this actually makes a lot of
sense when i saw you destroying that
camera out there no i was destroying the
camera because i don't want my wife to
see me make out with the ice cream man
you did that too okay baby you need to
go just
sit over there because i don't know
what's going on listen i destroyed the
camera i don't want her to catch me well

ice cream man but i think you hit jeffy

ask him
jeffy did he hit you with his car wait a
bit before you answer that jeffy
do you want free ice cream yeah he hit
me with his car

the street oh come on let me go i don't
