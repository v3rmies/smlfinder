i know we're rich buddy oh you're
looking super fly peepee oh you're
looking way more fly to you oh how much
money you think we have left in our
mcdonald's bag
probably a couple thousand in fact we've
been blowing money like whales
like whales yeah yeah you know like like
the blowhole that blows water
blowing money like whales yeah yeah okay
whatever yeah let's go see how much
money we have left let's kill count
let's get it all right peepee i'ma
sit back while you dump out all our cash
way ahead of you junior wait
that's it that's it how do we block
fifty thousand dollars in one day
i don't know we did rent the mclaren and
we drove it off a cliff oh
good time how much were your sunglasses
three thousand three thousand
yeah how much was your chain twenty
thousand god twenty thousand
well see how we blew that cash yeah we
did blow a lot of money
well at least we blew someone else's
money not ours there's nothing more fun
than blowing someone else's money yeah
you're right junior
who's the door i don't know let's go
answer with all our cool stuff on
right hello
hey do you see all the expensive stuff
we bought with money we found a
mcdonald's bag by a dumpster in l.a
yeah yeah it looks really expensive yeah
i feel sorry for the person who left
this money there i mean finders keepers
losers weavers right
really because i feel sorry for whoever
found the money why would you say that
well because the mafia sent me to find
the people who stole their money that
was in a mcdonald's bag by a dumpster in
l.a
well well well we've never been to la
really because that's literally where
you just told me you found the money
uh oh you got a mistake and we found our
money in a mcdonald's bag by a dumpster
in san francisco
oh what a coincidence well what are the
odds right yeah it's a small world i
mean we haven't been to la that's like 3
000 miles away
and i would know that because i was just
there when i found money on mcdonald's
so what would happen if uh we don't have
that money well then i'm gonna have to
break your legs
break our legs but i don't have legs
okay calm down i'll break your arms it's
fine okay we'll work something out
everybody's gonna get their limbs broken
no one's getting left out okay well what
if
we have the money well then you just pay
me back and we're good
okay uh chef pee pee let's go upstairs
and grab the money we spent all the
money
no we didn't we put it all on credit
card remember
i don't have a credit score i'm lying oh
we'll be right back mr dolphin okay sure
take your time
oh no junior i don't want my arms broken
how will i cook yeah maybe you should
let them break your arms
shut up junior well look let's check the
mcdonald's back one more time maybe
there's some money left over that we
didn't see
i hope so come on please oh look there's
more
that's enough no it's not just 101 he's
not gonna accept that
well would he accept a copy of 101
dalmatians shut up junior that's not
funny
well chef look look he said take your
time
right so we can honestly take as long as
we need to get the money i think he was
just saying that junior no no he said
take your time so even if it takes us 20
years to raise the 50 000
we can take our time
i guess so
is that him already oh no there's no way
that must be the pizza guy or something
hold on
we didn't order pizza uh hello hey i'm
gonna need you to hurry this up
you just said i could take my time i was
being sarcastic
is that a type of plastic no you just
said i could take my time so i thought i
had a couple years
no years no you have a couple minutes
well you didn't give me a couple minutes
you only gave me a couple seconds
you're like a hospital in antarctica you
have no patience
okay that was pretty good so i'll give
you one minute one minute get the money
yeah and then i'll break your legs after
that but if i give you the money you'll
break my leg no if you don't give me the
money i'll break your legs
okay just give me one minute all right
chef pee pee i got a plan
what's the plan junior i put this money
in the bag and give it to me
okay it's a foolproof plan
all right i got the mcdonald's bag with
money in it oh okay that's great hey
but before you grab it you have to
promise that no matter what's in this
bag you'll never come back
well there has to be money in it no i
promise on my life
that there's money in this mcdonald's
bag so once you grab this bag and you
see the money you'll never come back
well i don't know why i need to so sure
yeah all right so
here's the bag with money in it okay all
right never come back
all right chef pee pee i dealt with it
wait you did yeah he left and said he'll
never come back
really yup he's completely happy
hold on let me see what that's about um
uh hello what
you what are you doing here yeah there's
a hundred and one dollars in here
yeah well when you gave me the bag i
kind of assumed there'd be fifty
thousand dollars in here
because that's how much was originally
in here well i never said there was
fifty thousand dollars in there i said
there was money in the mcdonald's bag
and you accepted it you said
you would never come back if there was
money in the mcdonald's bag well yeah
that's true i did say that yeah and you
assumed
and you got to learn to never assume
because when you assume that makes what
it makes a bad word out of you and me
exactly so
you agreed that whatever amount of money
was not bad you would leave you didn't
specify how much
yeah that's true this is kind of my
fault too yeah so
i i i'm in the clear yeah i'm sorry i'll
go
talk to my boss about this yeah so see
you later all right chef pee pee he's
gone forever
wait really yeah he was happy with the
money no way jose
yes way pepe no no pablo hey
what are you doing here well i sent one
of my men to come collect my money but
apparently
you guys found a loophole while i was
busy spanking poop holes
and i want to know what you guys did
with my fifty thousand dollars
well we we spent it all ow
you spin it all you think just because i
like to store my money in a mcdonald's
bag
right beside a dumpster that you guys
could just spend all my money
well we thought it like with is random
money or mcdonald's money well the m on
the back didn't stand for mcdonald's it
stands for mr goodman
and that's my fifty thousand dollars and
you'll give me fifty thousand dollars
right now
oh wait we don't have the money chef why
don't you cook for him
junior am i cooking songs it better be a
fifty thousand dollar meal
chef your cooking actually doesn't suck
it's actually really amazing you cook
for jason willow you've cooked for so
many awesome people
look i know you could do it come on chef
just dig deep down and cook an amazing
meal
i guess so you're right junior i'll try
where's
my food here you go oh
is that a blue waffle chef if you're
supposed to make something good
i used to eat this all the time as a kid
my
mom had a blue waffle oh it was my
favorite

fifty thousand dollars
