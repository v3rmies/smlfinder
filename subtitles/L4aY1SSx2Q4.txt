i'm ripped that's a swimmer's body it's
because i'm a lifeguard
all right jeffy we're going to teach you
how to swim like a dolphin because you
almost drown in the bathtub so we're
going to teach you how to not do that
are there narwhals in this pool narwhals
no no there's no narwhals what about
octopushies
no no none of those either i wish there
were eight of those in there but no no
animals in the pool can we just start
the lesson
i'm sorry what are you jesus how are you
standing on the water
and also why are you fully clothed in
the pool i don't know what to wear
it's a pool have you never been to a
pool before
i mean like what are you showering in
all your clothes too no can we just
start the lesson please
all right jeffy the first rule of
swimming is that you got to make sure
you eat a full meal before you get in
the water well i thought you're not
supposed to eat before you get in the
pool because you'll cramp
up okay that's a myth see they just
don't want you swimming to your full
potential no no you gotta eat a whole
bunch of food before you get in the
water so that you have a lot of energy
to go swimming okay so jeffy i want you
to wolf this down
you get it wolf cause they're hot dogs
it's a swimmer's joke all right jeffy
eat all this food okay
uh i'm done i'm so full my stomach hurts
good good that pain is telling your body
that you're ready to swim we call that
swimmer's pain you know that's how
michael phelps won all those olympic
medals he had a whole plate of hot dogs
before every race is that true
i don't know google it all right jeffy
you ready to swim i'm staring in the
water i'm afraid it's going to hurt me
all the water's not going to hurt you he
had checked it whoa whoa whoa
see the water beat you no no it didn't
bite me it's just really really cold
you know i'm all ready to grow it not a
showa so when i get in there it's just
going to fall off
all right jeffy get in the water how
about you get in first you know because
he's kind of scared
okay yeah oh no
no no no no no can you just hurry up and
get in the water oh i'm sorry i can't
just float on top of the water like you

look i i paid you to give him swimming
lessons not floating around in a floatie
he can't bring that to the bathtub
okay listen man my plan is to flip over
the boat so he has no choice but to get
in the water
no he's gonna freak out well no no
sometimes you just gotta rip the
band-aid off you know he'll be fine
why can't you just teach me how to swim
like an old person um i'm sorry who's
the master swimming teacher here okay
you see this that's what sml stands for
swimming master lessons because that's
what i teach i teach people to become
master swimmers okay just trust me

right here
what i'm gonna go underwater now okay
um daddy where'd the instructor go
oh
[Applause]
you see that it can't get back to life
and he tried to drown me well they do
have nine lives
yeah i guess that's true hey i wanna go
home take me home right now
oh but we're just trying to teach you
how to swim yeah what you guys did was
after well
you already felt the water so you kind
of know what it's like to swim
what is that that's a narwhal
you told me there's no narwhals in the
pool it's not supposed to be
daddy i want to go home take me home
right now
oh come on okay we're gonna go home
since you suck at being a swimming
instructor oh
well today was a waste of time clearly
baby what happened to you someone
replaced my suntan lotion with cooking
oil
you look like an overcooked chicken yep
cause logan's clearly never cooked
chicken before so i think he meant
lobster but we'll go with overcooked
chicken
you look like a lobster thanks how did
jeffy's swimming lessons go
as they were bad they weren't really bad
mommy let me tell you what this bald guy
did
i was sitting there minding my own
business on my little inflatable float
and then he got his friend to flip me
over in the water and almost make me
drown
marvin that's so mean well look at least
jeffy got in the water and kind of swam
because he swam back to the inflatable
thing
so jeffy knows how to swim a little bit
so i think jeffy you should go try to
take a bath right now
all right daddy that's fine all right
we're gonna try to take a bath and see
if he improves okay
okay all right jeffy are you ready to
take a bath yup what
jeffy you cannot use this floaty every
time you take a bath yes i can because
it's the only thing that saved me from
drowning in that pool
jeffy you can't use this floaty
everywhere i guess you just got to take
showers for the rest of your life
okay well jeffy look you have to learn
how to swim because what if one day you
fall off a boat or something
what did i just take this with me
everywhere i'll go you can't do that
jeffy watch me
just get the shower
hey lavelle where did you get that cool
