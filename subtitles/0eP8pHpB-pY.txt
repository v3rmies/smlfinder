do you think someone stole it oh no
that's fine Karen I just spent half my
life savings to buy a Courtside ticket
to game six to watch the Miami Heat beat
the Boston Celtics
on basketball
tickets well I spent half of my life
savings because you just sit on the
couch you don't really do anything but
yeah I did but
is it worth it to go watch the Miami
Heat win the Eastern Conference and
smell Jimmy's ass as he runs by me yeah
I think it is Karen well Boyne I guess
if it means that much to you it'll be
nice for us to go together when do we
leave we uh oh no no that was for one
ticket just for me
had a hundred thousand dollars on one
two well yeah Karen I can't bring you I
don't want Jimmy to know I'm married so
whenever he wins and he lifts up that
trophy I can show him my jersey that
says Hemi Butler marry me and he'll kiss
me on the lips booty that man is not
gonna marry you yeah he will and besides
you're already married Boyne to me well
he's not gonna know that because when
we're on the flight over to Denver I'm
gonna send you divorce papers what if
they lose they're not gonna lose Karen
nobody has ever blown a 3-0 lead oh my
God buddy you're just not making any
sense yeah well people don't make sense

here and watch the game but don't be

I can't believe it he lost they lost
[ __ ] [ __ ] this is the worst day of my
[ __ ] life
I came here just to lose
I want to die I'm gonna kill myself
how was it pointy shitty I know corny
because I watched it and I watched you
lose a hundred thousand dollars well
look Karen don't you think I feel bad
enough I just went all the way over to
Miami just to watch them lose with 0.2
seconds left to the Boston suck dicks
you're right Boyne I'm sorry I yelled
well if you're mad now it's only gonna
get worse because I just bet the rest of
our life savings that Miami's gonna win
game seven
spent the rest of my money on a team
that just lost hey look Karen no team
has ever blown a 3-0 lead okay and
Jimmy's not gonna go out like a [ __ ]
he's a warrior but they just lost Boyne
that was a fluke Karen they put extra
seconds on the board I saw it with my
own two eyes would they lose though
we'll lose everything we'll lose the
house we'll lose our money and I'll
never speak to you again oh that sounds
like a win-win to me I mean I Lose My
Faith in Jimmy but I also lose you and I
can start a new life and hey if I win I
get three hundred thousand dollars oh
that is a lot of money yeah and I can
use that money to buy an engagement ring
so Jimmy will marry me I don't you
thought this through Oh I thought the
whole thing through Karen the wedding
the honeymoon we're gonna have a
honeymoon in Cancun and then we're gonna
settle down and have a nice little
family of Asian kids because we're gonna
adopt but don't worry there will be a
lot of sex okay that's very nice pointy
but why didn't you save that money so
that you could go to game seven well I'm
bad luck apparently because Jimmy was I
[ __ ] the [ __ ] out of me the whole
game I kept saying Jimmy Jimmy the
game's over there and then he blew me a
kiss and I caught it a little bit of
tongue but that's why you don't want to
go to game seven because I don't want to
distract him he needs to be focused okay
Bonnie when's the next game it's in a
couple days now I'm gonna go meditate in
the closet and pray to himie just don't
bother me
hear me
hear me pointy hear me Boyne the game's
about to start it's been two days
[ __ ] yeah it's time all right Karen I'm
ready hey could you turn the heater on I
want it nice and hot in here for this
dog well Jimmy has never lost a game
while I was sitting on this couch eating
a 12-inch hot dog while meat riding him
people say meet right Jimmy Butler and
they're right I do tricks on that thing
this right here that's Jimmy's wiener
actually I bet it's even bigger than
this
it's gross have you seen the remote
Karen I don't want to miss the game well
boy uh why don't you look at the TV what
what are these highlights from the last
game wait wait did they already win yeah
Yeah well yeah but why didn't you come
get me because I was gonna leave you in
that closet forever pointy if they lost
but they won yeah yeah they did win
Jimmy actually did it go Jimmy you think
he won because I was in the closet
meditating uh oh yeah pointy definitely
so so I should be in the closet for
every game yes boy and save us all that
money oh I'm gonna do that from now on
screw this hot dog it's nugget time this
is what Jimmy Butler's gonna do the
Denver Nuggets it's gonna rub him on his
balls then he's gonna eat them the
Nuggets suck actually they're pretty
good actually they're very good I'll be
surprised if we win one single game you
don't think we're gonna win pointy no no
I don't well I hope we win oh I do too
if we win the finals I'm gonna get 22
tattooed on my back and then I'm gonna
get property of Jimmy Butler tattooed on
my butt and then I'm gonna have him do a
hand turkey and my left ass cheek like a
kidner gardener now I hope they lose
loose Jimmy doesn't know the meaning of
the word lose he almost blew a 3-0
but did he no he didn't so shut up I
don't want to hear that
get out of here with that weak [ __ ]
they're not gonna lose but I'm gonna be
in the closet for the next few days
until the finals start and I'm gonna
take these nuggets with me because I
haven't eaten in two days I'll be in the
closet eating nuggets
oh yeah yeah just just one more thing
one more thing real quick
