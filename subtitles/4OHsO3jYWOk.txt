recycling recycling is when you reuse
something over and over and over
nineties water wha see I've already
finished drinking the water out of it so
instead of putting it in the trash can
I could reuse it I could put more water
in there and continue drinking out of it
or I could even peel I know the whole
small but that not a problem for me cuz
I got a tiny egg roll you know I'm
saying oh if I'm really accurate I could
even poop in there and save thousands
and thousands of gallons of water a year
instead of flushing the toilet oh I
could get put more water now it took a
shower you know so any punches Crocs
I've been using the same water bottle
for years dude I use it for everything
