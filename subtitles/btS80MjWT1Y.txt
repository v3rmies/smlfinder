oh no my dad's trophy houston we have a
problem
that's space jeffy not airlines
yeah that's airlines oh no my dad loved
this trophy

on an airport runway
yeah we were cleared for landing it was
kind of irresponsible what's that noise
that sounds like a trophy rod jeffy my
dad's coming
what was that noise my trophy
who would do such a thing what was that
noise oh you
i knew you were jealous of my trophy i
didn't do this then who did
someone probably threw that big
inflatable airplane at it yeah
you because you were jealous no i don't
even know where to get a big inflatable
airplane like that i don't even know
where that came from
probably online you probably went to
amazon prime and it had it shipped here
i don't know if you have a membership or
not

know what happened then who did
okay well maybe someone broke into the
house and threw that plane at your
trophy

inflatable plane and threw it at my
trophy

you so they could steal your tv or
something distract me for my tv
