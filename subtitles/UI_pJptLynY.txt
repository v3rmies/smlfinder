so joseph what do you want to do today i
don't know dude
me either hey what's up guys uh it's
harry my god what do you want harry yeah
well i was selling my pokemon card
collection and i was wondering if you
guys were interested in buying any well
do you have any polly wags or poly
whirls or probably your ass or probably
toads
no they don't talk to me i lose you so
lame but i do have a couple cool ones
like this charizard right here it is a
holographic a real
penny dropper that's lame okay well i
also have this mewtwo
it's actually a shadowless first edition
shadowless yes so like we don't get six
more weeks of winter i don't understand
no it doesn't have a shadow so if you
look at the charizard there's a shadow
around the picture
on the mewtwo the first edition it
doesn't have that
so how many girls you get with that
yeah yeah no don't talk to me unless you
have some polly's because i have the
complete poly collection but don't flex
on them dude
what's the polly collection oh my god
joseph i gotta do it too
don't do it i gotta show him the polly
clown show him dude
you messed up now all right harry let me
show you where you failed at life
he's gonna start crying get ready to be
depressed i got my polly wag
my polywhirl my polly wrath and my polly
toad oh yeah the tears are flowing i see
them next page my polytote ex is my
prized possession
and i just got you know pages pages of
polly's i got so many pollys you know
you'll never beat me so uh just read it
and weep well i hate to tell you this
junior
but none of your poly collection is
shadowless
or first edition what so it's still
worth a lot of money like maybe one day
i'll sell them for 10 million if someone
begs me yeah
no to be honest with you junior your
collection isn't worth
anything yeah it is i got every single
polly like
every single party ever look at all of
them no junior look
your police have shadows around the
picture just like
this charizard the mewtwo is shadowless
in first edition
yours doesn't even have the first
edition step these
are worthless so you're saying there's
paulies out there that that are first
edition and shadowless there are
just like this regis steel ex
that was graded by psa a psa 10
gem mint and there are polys out there
that are encapsulated just like this one

really want to buy
nobody want to hear about pokemon cards
junior they're worthless well they're
worth 30 000
