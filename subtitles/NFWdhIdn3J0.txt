one thing leads to another
so i just want to play it safe 18 or not
you know call me in two years we'll see
what happens oh
there's nothing you could do like what's
wrong with him i mean he's dead man

don't really want to say it out loud
i'm sorry what he shut up
okay should i be getting my cop uniform
oh no no no no no no no
this is what happens look i took this
nerf gun and i put green beads in it
because jeffy wouldn't eat his green
beans and i shot him down his throat and
then he choked
i don't this isn't really looking too
good for you
it was an accident
could you keep it down we're trying to
have a conversation could you just take
that to another level
my god you have to live with that jesus
i was i was gonna arrest you but that's
punishment enough you're going to be
deaf
well so so jeffy's really dead yeah he's
dead
like he's gone forever he's like there's
no bringing him back yeah that's what
dead means
there's nothing you can do to bring
jeffy back i mean you could try burying
him in the pet cemetery
what's that well it's a movie i saw one
time it's like these people they bury
their pets in like the cemetery and the
pets come back to life
is that real no man it's a movie oh
why would you tell me about that i just
thought it was cool i don't know
so you can't bring jeffy back to life no
sorry
i can help you bury him though you can
help me bury you yeah i'll go get my
shovel and i guess we could just bury
him in the backyard like a like a pet
hamster or something
oh come on oh jeffy i'm so sorry
all right he's buried oh poor jeffy
it's a good thing you had a spare piece
of wood we could call ripping through
though oh i miss
him so much it's all my fault oh yeah
some advice
if you ever sell your house uh let the
people who live here after you know that
your son's buried in the backyard you
don't want them getting a nasty surprise
when they try to put a pool in
okay i'll remember that
jeffy's gone forever oh we have to
remember him by is this helmet
oh baby i'm so sorry but we can always
make another one
what do you mean mario we can always
make another jeffy
but jeffy ate all the play doh
i didn't mean make him out of play-doh
then what did you mean mario
just forget it look just after a while
it'll be like jeffy never existed
you did this it was an accident i was
just trying to feed him with vegetables
and it cost him his life
look if i could bring jeffy back i would
you know i would i didn't mean for that
i didn't even
choke you know i didn't know what was
gonna happen i thought he was gonna eat
his vegetables
maybe if i could bring jeffy back i
would but that'll never happen
he's gone forever is that my phone
jeffy's calling should jeffy answer it

all right jeffy look get away from
rosalina come closer to me
come closer to me
you touched me
i don't know what happened i don't know
like he just showed up at our front door
breathing like that and acting all scary
like maybe he's still alive maybe he
needs medical attention well i guess i
could give him like a like an
examination or something
i mean clearly his arm is missing and
that eye looks like it's gone bad
wait jeffy show us the top of your head
oh yeah his brain's sticking out that's
not good was it like that already
i don't know he always wore a helmet so
i don't know if his brain was taken out
oh well i do like those sweet designer
jeans he's wearing
hey hey you get those that abba zombie
and fitch
you get it like like abercrombie and
fish is the clothing store but
but he's a zombie you know so like he'd
chop and have a zombie in a fetch
yeah yeah you get like a zombie and fish
because it's you know it's like a pun
you know okay is there anything you can
do about our son biggest zombie like can
you bring him back to life
well i don't know about that but i do
know zombies eat brains and we should
probably get him some brains before he
gets hungry yeah
we don't want him to eat our brains oh i
just remembered i have a whole bunch of
brains in my car i'll be right back oh
okay
[Music]
these brains look delicious why do you
have a plate full of brains in your car
what you don't like to get a little road
brain i like to munch on these while i'm
driving
you eat brains well yeah when you eat
somebody's brain you learn everything
they know like let me check this guy out
oh okay okay did you know that when the
queen ant dies all the other ants in the
colony also die because they live off of
the queen's poop
that guy was an entomologist okay well
we should maybe feed these brains to
jeffy he's the one that's a zombie
oh yeah sure here you go jeffy jeffy
chew with your mouth closed all right
so now that he's eating those brains
what do we do can we turn jeffy back
into a human
i don't know oh i have an idea if i if i
try
tasting all these brains maybe one of
them will know what to do okay
okay let me try this one
jeffy oh okay
oh okay okay yeah i i think i know what
to do what well you see
jeffy came back from the dead because he
wants to teach you a lesson
now if only one of these brains spoke
zombie
yeah that was the one okay jeffy
[Music]
what's he saying
uh-huh i see i see what do you want well
you see what jeffy needs
is he needs you to stick your head in a
porta potty for 10 minutes
what yeah that's what he wants
is there anything else i can do well let
me ask
you no that's what he wants
go do it okay i'll do it i'll i'm going
to put a body okay there's a porta potty
the powder he once told me oh hey donkey
shrek you were in there yeah donkey i
gave birth to a little crap baby out of
my butthole
eight pounds three ounces donkey i'm a
proud mommy
so it stings really bad in there oh yeah
donkey i think the stench is starting to
breach the doorway
hurry up and get a whiff donkey one two
three all right do it with me donkey
oh god it smells so bad yeah donkey if
you're gonna go in there i think you're
gonna need a gas mask don't get
oh okay
[Laughter]
oh god i did it i did it was so gross
but i did it
that was payback daddy for you making me
in your green beans
what we got you good mario wait you were
a part of this
i did the makeup makeup yeah daddy this
is
all makeup come on pretty girl and who
do you think really amputated jeffy's
arm so you could pull it off
me so all you guys were in on this
why mario you shouldn't force feed jeffy
to eat green beans
yeah daddy and whatever you experienced
out in that porta potty
is exactly what happens every time i
have to eat green beans
i guess you guys are right i shouldn't
just force feed jeffy green beans
i should actually feed him nutritional
foods and with protein and
other types of stuff from the food
pyramid it shouldn't just be green beans
i'm sorry jeffy for all these years of
me trying to force feed you green beans
i promise i'll be a better dad and feed
you different foods
pee pee that's what i'm talking about
daddy
all right jeffy where's my 20 bucks oh
it's right here i don't know
thank you all right jeffy come on let's
go get your arm sewed back on
[Music]
