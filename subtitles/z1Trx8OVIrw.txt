[Music]
what's wrong Cody well it's just that me
and Ken want to have a baby but we can't
cuz we're two dudes he's a dog Cody he's
not a dog J why do you and Ken want have
a baby well it's just that we've been
together for a long time and it would be
cool to have a little Ken junor running
around where do babies even come from
dude I think girls po them out of their
butts e yeah that's what I heard but we
don't have a girl's butt so I made a
machine that can make babies you made a
machine that can make babies yeah let me
go get
it behold you guys baby machine b y
machine patent pending wa baby machine
what's it do yeah what I just explained
that it makes babies well how's it work
oh well you put the DNA of one person
here and then you put the DNA of another
person here and then the machine
combines the DNA to make a baby well if
you already made a baby machine why' you
even tell us about it why don't you just
make a baby oh well cuz Ken here doesn't
have any DNA because he's a doll dude no
Joseph it's because his DNA got burned
off when he was in space exploring the
universe and he encountered aliens cuz
he had to save the planet of quadrillion
and the only way he could save it is if
they burned off all his DNA what do you
even hear yourself dude well look guys
the point is I need someone's DNA well
you can't have mine I don't even like
you dude I guess I'll give you my DNA
since we're best buds well Junior I was
actually thinking we'd use Chef pee's
DNA Chef pee's DNA why his have you seen
him he is gorgeous my DNA combined with
his our baby would be rocking he'd be a
supermodel Chef peip is really hot yeah
he's banging okay so how do we get Chef
pee's DNA okay I was thinking I would
dress up like a girl right and then I'd
go on Tinder and then I'd match with him
and then we'd go on a date and then he
invite me back to his house and then
he'd want to do it but then I'd be like
no I want to wait till marriage and then
we wait and we date for 2 years and then
when we finally get married we go on a
honeymoon to Hawaii and then right when
we're about to make sweet passionate
love I pluck out one of his hairs and
run away isn't there a quicker way to do
it I mean I guess you could just get his
hair right now from the kitchen but I
mean that'd be boring and I already have
the girl outfit ready I'm just going to
go grab one of his hairs right now A
come on I already bought the plane
tickets Junior your ham and cheese
