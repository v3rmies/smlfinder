amazing summer ever
only four hundred dollars per person
jesus christ
guys we have to go yeah we have to go
dude guys it's four hundred dollars a
person we can't afford that
the reason why it's so expensive is
there's so much fun stuff to do they
have to keep the place open yeah like
the water slides dude
and the video games well look guys if
the cockfighting was what i thought it
was then it might be worth it but 400
is just crazy well what if we're the
only kids that don't go
junior trust me no kid can afford to go
there that place must be a ghost town
you're right it's super expensive no
one's going to that
guys guys guys what's up toad
other name for frog guys are throwing a
huge party at fun building you're all
invited but you got to pay for your own
ticket

[Music]
breaking news okay if you have an old
vintage kindle
in pristine condition just sitting
around it can be worth up to two
thousand dollars because it's a rare
collectible

be dropping a nuclear bomb
on funville decimating the entire place
create a crater in the ground

the location for 40 plus years due to
radiation
