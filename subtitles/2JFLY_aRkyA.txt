okay so I'm playing Grand Theft Auto 5
and level tells me to do a challenge
that he uh created and it's where you go
around the entire map on the
interstate uh and see if you can survive
with three stars any car you want and I
don't believe that it's that hard
because I mean I have a Bugatti
completely maxed out with armor and
everything but he said it's impossible
to go across the entire map uh without
dying or blowing up or anything you have
to go around the whole map and come back
from where you started I'm going to
start right here uh I probably should
start right here but he says I won't
even make it from right here so I'm
going to see if he can explain it better
all right so what you do is that you
have you can get any car soup it up
however you want to get whatever
attachments all that J whatever to your
car and you have one you can use that
one car you have three stars on you you
have to make it all the way around the
map all the way like up top on the
interstate just come all the way down
yeah yeah and all the way back right
there and then see if you can make it
all the way around without dying one
time you can switch a car if your car
ends up blowing up cuz I'm pretty sure
your car is going to blow up cuz it's
very difficult but the main point is you
got to survive without doing a health
cheat or anything yeah no health cheats
uh but uh if you want to get uh your
wanted level without injuring your car
you do the cheat code uh but when I was
doing it the police have already started
shooting at me so I'm going to start
with already bullet holes but I still
think I can do it so I'm going to start
right about
now okay so the cops already behind me
I'm telling you it's going to be
easy you say that get music I got closer
with a a boo boo car bro like get that
was
[ __ ] that was no [ __ ] you died off
the okay no redo it that wasn't oh sh
oh oh man how you die off the
back this [ __ ] didn't even get far on
the interstate yet this dude is like
still on the inter you got a merge left
right
here okay so let me go get one of my
other
cars okay okay so we're doing a restart
I got four stars this time so uh but you
didn't beat it with three stars you just
want to go I'm going to beat it with
four Stars see that I need more stars
okay so I need to make it all the way
around the map on the interstate
oh I'm already starting to get
scared no I thought that was a get out
of my
way I hate how the police cars are so
fast in this
game and it doesn't matter how much
armor you have on the car it can not
going the right way I'm not I'm not
going the right way no damn it now we
have have started the challenge
officially cuz I'm actually going the
right way so as long as no one helps him
out then I'm going to do
good so there's no worries in life oh
you see that
explosion Oh serious what can I use my
guns I uh would it be smarter to go in
the incoming
Lane I mean
I do it with half of the time like half
the time I'm riding on there I like to
ride in the incoming Lane because it
slows them down half the time okay so
I'm on the interstate now now the
challenge is started I have a red car
instead of a Bugatti and I'm going to
pass it this time uh I'm doing it with
three stars this time what if I lose my
stars I shouldn't I me you won't
lose oh they there they're
there okay I I feel good about this one
I'm going to do it this time the Bugatti
was just cursed if you do it with
Bugatti you can't do it uh but with this
car I'm definitely going to
do so
yeah and I don't believe in using the
special ability cuz I think that's
cheating no it's not bro I'm not using
with the ability no I'm not going to use
a special
ability nope I can do it without this
visual ability let me turn off the music
there's no point in having the music on
uh get out
no oh I don't like that no no no no no
you
di no no as long as they stay in their
cars oh
yeah I got to away you're done man no I
I'm still going pretty fast and they
can't get
me I think I'm halfway
done no nowhere near halfway you just
started he like e eighth of a way
done and you can't go off the near can't
take shortcuts got to go the whole
entire way I'm just afraid my tire
popping or or going loose that was easy
no I wish everyone was like that
one
uh there's not that many police in
California get out get out of the way
damn it
I'm GNA do it and you're going to feel
stupid
stupid yeah three stars is pretty
hard no got
buy do I have any
guns I don't know how do you choose your
gun no I haven't I have not played
I don't know on Xbox I can't tell I
think it's the
same isn't it like
the I I guess I don't have any guns with
this guy cuz I None of the buttons are
working oh
crap okay I think I'm doing pretty good
I I I'm going to check my progress
um yeah use your use your Waypoint to
navigate it so you can see how far
oh yeah there you go okay let me let me
so once like you get up top to like no
it's it's not it's already there that's
where I
started okay so I got
6.81 miles which is very far compared to
real life I think I'm actually going to
lose my wanted level there's no cops
ahead oh never mind I got to try to
catch the cop CU I don't want my laed
level that that would suck there it is
I'm right
here winning winning oh They Se winning
get out of the way
oh he's not going to get me this time
I'm telling you this car is whoa this
car is going to get me
through the Bugatti was cursed the
Bugatti didn't have seat
belts they made re they made the Bugatti
without seat
belts if I pass it with this I'm doing
it with five STS
because I don't think F you just got up
to the top
Corner they're not going to do it with
themall

out of gas I mean I've been flooring it
the whole time oh what is he
drunk Dam dam it Dam damn it damn it
damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it
