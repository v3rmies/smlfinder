never mind i thought you had a pet
goldfish still gonna kill you though
hahahahaha codeweeb oh

junior you just texted me while you were
in the bathroom no i didn't i didn't

no battery junior they called me
codeweave and you're the only person
that calls me that what codeweave that's
a really good nickname but
cody i did not text you i didn't even
have my phone in the bathroom i was just
washing my hands
junior i know it's you it's not me cody
it's scout's honor
you're not a scout that doesn't mean
anything to me cody would i ever do
anything mean to you
junior you tried to burn my house down
earlier and then after that you put a
bag of poop outside my front door
okay and you stepped in it no i did it
it turned out squished her toes
cody look i did not text you that's not
me i promise i swear on my life i do not
text you okay so it's really not you
it's not me well then i'm gonna call the
police because someone's threatening my
life well at least you're gonna call the
right person this time you're not gonna
call the fire department over a crime
all right i'm gonna go call him he's
such an idiot i totally had my fingers
crossed when i saw my life oh
you're so smooth dude no smooth hey
there this kid says you've been sending
them death threats
me no yes you junior
joseph you've been my boy for years yep
would i do anything bad like that nope
see officer i would not send bad
messages like that
cody's a nerd and he wanted to set the
popular table at lunch
and i wouldn't let him because he's ugly
and so now she's getting back at me
trying to get me arrested
why would you lie to me i'm not lying to
you he's the one that's lying well
i'm not lying i know it's illegal to lie
to a police officer yeah that's right
we have a pretty easy way of figuring
out who sent the messages see i have a
software that can track the message to
see what phone it came from so whenever
we find that person they're going to
jail
jail yeah jail you go to jail for
sending messages
yeah sending death threats is illegal
well well what if it was just a big joke
well it doesn't matter if it's a joke
it's still illegal well what if the
person
messages and says this whole thing with
a joke don't take it seriously did he do
that
no uh well hold on i gotta go use the
bathroom
oh this thing was a joke don't take it
seriously
huh magic got back from using the
bathroom i was really quick with that
huh hold on that guy sent a text message
while you were in the bathroom hmm this
means something but
but what it means it's him officer
it's not me look just because the guy
coincidentally sent a text message well
i was in the bathroom doesn't mean it
was me
it's not me look i promise it's not me
go trace the number
and it's not going to come back to me
okay we're going to trace the number
we're going to figure this out well
officer uh hypothetically if it was me
and i hypothetically smashed my phone
would you be able to trace
to my phone no because your phone's
broken so we wouldn't be able to find it
okay so i just want to know that wait
why would you ask me that
because the new iphone 12 is coming out
and i really want it so if i smash my
phone on youtube reviews
i'll make that youtube money and i can
buy the new iphone 12. oh yeah that's a
great idea make sure you get it slow-mo
it'll be awesome
yeah i'm totally gonna do that let me go
break my phone
i'm sorry thomas
this is how i type this is how i type
this is how i stay
all right let's track that message all
right i just smashed my phone
dude smashville population one what
yep so i smashed my phone hey officer
any luck tracing that number
that's weird i can't seem to find the
phone anywhere all i'm getting is helen
kellersimulated.org
well i don't know what to tell you i
guess you can't trace it
he obviously smashed his phone so you
wouldn't be able to find it well no
no he said he was going to make a
youtube video with him smashing his
phone
wait kid where's the video what video
the video you smashing your phone
oh darn it i forgot to record it huh
that's kind of suspicious but then again
i forget stuff all the time like the
other day i forgot to not cheat on my
wife can you believe that it's like
oops shouldn't have done that yeah i'm
so forgetful but
i guess since you can't trace the number
we should just stop it here the case is
closed right
yeah it's too bad i really want to know
who did it yeah the case is closed
wait what's this what cody you're still
gonna die what
die cody die junior how are you doing
this well i'm not sending those messages
my phone smashed wait but it was you
before though right
yeah but no it's not me wait then who's
doing this look cody look
look at my hand i'm not doing i'm
totally not doing like my phone is
smashed
i can't be sending those texts you can
track the message though right
yeah yeah i can do that all right let's
see who this is type
type type type type type uh oh what
the messages seem to be coming from
inside the house
well really yeah and if you're here
then uh oh
can you see what what what part of the
house it's coming from yeah hold on
oh no it looks like it's coming from the
kitchen
oh let's go in the kitchen see what it
die is die at home die in rome wait
don't die i'm wrong that's too nice
die somewhere else worse you're the
texter
oh i am chef pee pee how could you
cody you threw a roll of toilet paper at
my head and make me knock over my pasta
wait
is this true a salt but yeah he also
broke my piggy bank
destruction of personal property all
they did was throw a roll of toilet
paper
tell them why you threw the roll of
toilet paper because i was mad
okay yeah you also have anger issues
okay look
it's five o'clock in the morning and
we're all really tired okay so you
chef you're a grown man you shouldn't be
sending mean messages to this kid
and you kid you gotta learn how to
manage your anger
and you you broke your phone for a lie
that can't have been worth it all right
we all just need to grow up
we all need to learn some lessons today
and the lessons are be nice
just don't say mean things to people and
if you're watching this at home
just leave it leave a comment below if
you can think of a better ending than
the one we came up with
because we're all tired and this is the
best we got so i'm gonna try to read the
best ending that
people came up with at the end of the
next video
[Music]
