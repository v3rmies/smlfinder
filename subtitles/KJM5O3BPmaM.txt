more for good luck
what are you doing on the roof i drink a
red bull so it gave me wings
dude that's a commercial they don't give
you actual weeds or maybe they're
invisible wings
dude you better not jump please don't
watch me fly baby
there you go kid you're roll bandaged up
all right kid i hope you learned your
lesson don't believe everything you see
on tv
red bull doesn't really give you wings
next time drink a monster instead cause
it really turns you into a monster just
ask my wife
yeah he gets really angry yeah i'm
trying to get help for it
i try to call the cops but i can't
because he is one
yeah that's right now you get home right
now
julia what happened to the wings that
you took oh i left them outside sorry
chef pee pee julie it took me forever to
make those wings well you don't think
it's so angry about it
well he must have drank a monster man
just so angry all the time
wanna hit something
uh i'm gonna hang up on him real quick
yeah do that do that uh sorry about that
chef pee pee wait junior what happened
to your legs oh i saw a red bull
commercial and it said if you drink a
red bull you'll get wings so i drank a
bunch of red bulls and i jumped off the
roof and i broke my legs dude you're
such an
idiot why would you jump off the roof oh
it's a commercial you won't get actual
wings well the red bull commercial said
red bull gives you wings so i drank a
red bull i thought it would give me
wings and i could fly
well did you get your wings no exactly
it's a commercial you idiot
i should sue them for false advertising
oh you idiot you can't sue them
want a bet all right kid so let me get
this straight
you want to sue red bull because you
didn't grow wings after you drank it
yeah see i saw the commercial it said
red bull gives you wings so i drank it
because i thought i was going to grow
wings i'd be able to fly but i didn't
grow wings i end up falling and breaking
both my legs
well i've seen the commercial and after
watching the commercial
i would think it's just a silly cartoon
and i wouldn't believe what it said
well you see if the word wings had three
eyes in it then i wouldn't believe it
but it's spelt perfectly as wings
so i want to sue them for false
advertising because i think i have a
case okay all right well let me see what
i can do
all right kids so i got you 10 000 for
your settlement with red bull
and red bull has agreed to change their
slogan from
red bull gives you wings to red bull
gives you wings
so the word wings is gonna have three
eyes in it instead of one
good good hopefully nobody else will get
hurt like i did yeah so uh what are you
gonna spend the ten thousand dollars on
i know i'm gonna buy a buzz lightyear
toy
all right now that i bought this cool
buzz lightyear toy maybe he could teach
me how to fly because he knows how to
fly
all right buzz lightyear teach me how to
fly
oh infinity and beyond
that's all i gotta say is to infinity
and beyond okay but but but
how do i take off i mean you have wings
right let me see
okay okay i get it i need to break the
wings off this buzz lightyear toy
and then i'll be able to fly as long as
i say to infinity and beyond
yeah i'm gonna break him off his back oh
yeah
i'm gonna fly daddy's gonna fly today
hey joseph
dude is that bus light your wings yeah
i'm gonna fly for real
to infinity and beyond
you gotta stop doing dangerous stuff kid
i just wanted to fly like buzz lightyear
did in toy story
he doesn't fly in toy story you idiot
didn't you see the movie he falls down
that his arm breaks off
karen give me another monster okay boy
i'm gonna sue toy story for making me
try to imitate and fly like buzz
lightyear
you can't sue toy story kid it's just a
cartoon watch me so let me get this
straight kid
you want to sue pixar because you
decided to imitate something that you
saw in one of their movies
no i want to sue toy story because i
imitated something i saw in toy story
well pixar created toy story so you have
to sue pixar look i just want to sue
somebody because i got hurt trying to do
something i saw in a movie and i tried
to fly like buzz lightyear did in the
movie
okay well if you want to fly like buzz
lightyear buzz lightyear also straps
himself to a rocket and he started
flying so if you wanted to fly you
should have distracted yourself to a
rocket
yeah that would work i mean i wouldn't
have wings but
at least i would fly and the girl would
think i was cool all right thanks for
the idea
okay i got a bottle rocket i'm gonna
listen to my lawyer and strap myself to
this because then i'll actually fly and
then that girl will love me all right
let's do it
[Applause]
whoa let me get this straight you want
to sue me because i told you to strap
yourself to a rocket
and you actually did it well you told me
to do it so i thought it was a good idea
but the rocket blew up and i blew up
into a million pieces
well it's not my fault you're an idiot
well i want to sue you for a billion
dollars because you told me to do it
well i'm not paying you a billion
dollars
get back here i'm just ahead oh
what do i do i don't have wings or a
body
i guess i'm just gonna go to bed huh i
guess i'll just go to sleep because i'll
never get wings
oh and for the people wondering how i
got my body back
this is a youtube video it's not real
unless i invite joseph for a sleepover
and then i break his wings with a hammer
and then he will be able to fly and the
girl like me
yeah that's what i do i'm gonna go call
joseph oh man i can't wait for joseph to
get here because as soon as he gets here
we're gonna go to sleep and i'm gonna
break his wings with this hammer so that
he can't fly and that girl will like me

the worst nightmare
you were gonna bring my wings with a
hammer because you were jealous that the
girl liked me more than you
whoa joseph that's a crazy insane
nightmare i can't believe your mind
would even think of something that crazy
i know dude i know
but look i'm gonna go and stay tonight

to change for them
yeah you know what joseph what dude
