so guys what do you want to do today i
don't know dude i'm bored
well i do have 500 and i don't know what
to spend it on
you don't know what to spend it on on
playstation 5. yeah they're out right
now dude yeah you can play spider-man
explore a new world you have to get a
playstation 5 right now cody
i don't know i was thinking about buying
a new telescope ah
what was that for junior a telescope a
freaking telescope oh my god he's oozing
nerd right now
you're the biggest fattest ugliest nerd
i've ever seen if you buy a telescope
with that money but i get i could
explore new worlds with my telescope
what are you gonna say with a dumb
telescope well i could look at planets
like i could look at uranus
and then i could get the telescope cody
if you get a playstation 5
i can play it joseph i can play it i can
play it some more
i could play it i could play it again it
just sounds like you want me to get a
ps5 so you can play it well of course
but we would all play it especially me
and i know santa claus will get me one
for christmas but i don't want to wait
that long i don't want elf juice all
over my playstation 5. so just go buy it
please
but junior if i get a telescope we can
all look through it and what are we
going to say your big mom's fat
hairy butt i don't want to let your big
mom's hairy butt you cody like like she
can stand on the other side of the
country and i can see with my naked eye
how fat she is because she's so fat
like she's fat right joseph yeah dude
that was a good burn
fat mom cody okay guys i think you've
helped me make my decision on what i'm
gonna buy oh he's gonna buy these he's
totally gonna get the playstation he's
gonna get the points
all right guys i'm back
isn't it cool guys how did you get the
playstation 5 box oh well the guy that
sold me the telescope used the money to
buy a ps5 and then he let me use the box
to carry the telescope
can we be friends with him instead
please come on guys the telescope is so
cool
no no it's not i mean look at that
that's carbon fiber
joseph how do we kill him dude um bury
him in your backyard
and then get a pool made on top of them
that way the police can never dig them
up
hey cody did you hear my dad's getting a
pool installed in my backyard
oh that that that's cool i mean i can't
swim but that could be fun
you guys want to come outside and play
with my telescope cody why would you buy
a telescope and not a playstation 5.
because the playstation 5 just didn't
really sound that cool to me it didn't
sound cool
fun didn't sound cool to you video games
didn't sound cool to you
having a better life than have owning a
telescope didn't sound cool to you
owning a telescope just seemed cooler
what would you what do you think galileo
would do if he had 500
and he could buy a telescope or a
playstation he probably would buy a
telescope
well then galileo's lame just like you
guys are you gonna come outside and look
at stars with me or not
i guess we have nothing better to do
unless we want to look at the
playstation box it better be cooler than
the playstation look at the playstation
box looks cooler so far
all right guys are you ready to look at
stars oh
cool oh look at that oh boring

playstation right now i know dude

we no i discovered a new planet i'm the
one that saw it first but it's my
telescope we wouldn't have even seen it
if i hadn't gotten the telescope but i
saw it first so i just discovered a
green planet
oh okay okay calm down let's call nasa
and they'll tell us if it even is a new
planet yeah let's go call nasa
hey there you call nasa oh you guys got
a ps5
sweet no it's just the box why what
happened he had 500
to buy a ps5 but he bought a telescope
instead oh
nerd i worked for nasa and i wouldn't
have bought a telescope right
but anyway i was using this dumb stupid
telescope and i discovered a new planet
there's no way we've been looking for
years we know there's no new planets in
our solar system but we actually found a
new planet though
no i found the new planet not we with my
telescope but i saw it with my eyes i
don't even know why you bought a
telescope you have two telescopes on
your face
okay okay okay let's just go outside and
look at this new planet yeah come on
look i'll show you
all right so if you just look inside
there you'll see a green planet okay
huh what wait a minute what is that well
well it's round and it's green so
that looks like a new planet to me so i
discovered a new planet oh my god i
think you boys actually might have
discovered a new planet
i discovered a new planet i gotta go
alert the news well told it was me i
discovered it
[Music]
breaking news okay three young boys have
discovered a new planet in our solar
system
more on the story as it develops three
boys
i'm a man i'm not much of one but i am
one no not
three one one kid discovered it and i
was the kid that discovered it hey
guys i'm the guy in the group project
that gets an a for doing nothing
yeah why they acknowledge joseph he
didn't do anything junior you just have
to accept that you didn't discover it
i did discover i saw it with my eye you
were eyebagging your telescope for 30
minutes and you didn't see it until i
left the telescope and i saw the planet
myself well you saw it with my telescope
that i bought well i would have saw it
even if i didn't use your stupid
telescope really you could see it
without a telescope yeah if i would have
just looked up
and saw it i would have saw it well then
why haven't you seen it before because
i've never looked up
you've never looked up ever nope i've
never looked up so you've never seen the
moon
what's that junior what there's someone
at the door hold on
uh hello hey there i need to talk to you
kids oh yeah sure come on inside
hey there kids so what's up the
international space station that's
what's
up because it's up in space that's
that's a little nasty joke for you you
wouldn't get it you got to be a part of
nasa to understand
anyway i brought you guys this
certificate so you can name your new
planet because you all discovered a new
planet no
i discovered a new planet junior he said
we we all did but i saw it first with my
eyeball well you saw it on my telescope
well you see that's actually the weird
thing is that we can't actually find the
new planet on any other telescopes but
yours you hear that junior we can only
find it on my telescope but i'm the one
who saw it with my eyeball so maybe i
made it appear with my eyeball
but we found it with my telescope and
that's the only one oh let me ask him
hey nasa guy so listen i saw the planet
first with my eyeball he bought the
telescope but i saw the planet first so
who owns the planet
[Music]
i don't care i really don't care
i just need you guys to fill this out
name your new planet and then name who
the owner is i'll be by later to pick up
the paper
so what am i going to name the new
planet no junior i'm naming the planet
no i'm naming it because i discovered it
what would you even name it cody i would
name it planet hunkylon and all of the
hunkiest guys in the galaxy would get to
live there that's so lame cody well what
would you name it i would name it
guacamole
guacamole you can't name a planet
guacamole it's already a food but the
plant is green like guacamole and then
at dinner parties people would be like
can you pass me the guacamole and
they're like yeah hold on oh it's all
the way in space i have to go get it you
want to name an entire planet guacamole
just so people can make jokes at dinner
parties yeah and the kids would be like
dad where's guacamole from oh it's from
the planet guacamole i agree with junior
it is a good name thanks joseph
okay okay how about we let joseph decide
what me him he didn't do sh
anything yeah exactly he's not involved
so he doesn't have an opinion one way or
the other we should let him decide
what would you name the planet joseph oh
if i could name it i would probably name
it
planet
okay that sucks joseph can't name the
planet yeah that's so lame so you just
let me name it no
no i think we should flip a coin for it
all right um
i'm gonna call heads okay tails tails
tails
no you call tails in the air no no it
sailed and i called it uh
in the air so that means i win because i
said tails last you should have
said tails before it landed okay you
know what junior screw it i don't even
care anymore you can name the planet i
don't care
yes planet guacamole here i come
i want my booger back
[Music]

it's so stupid hey there you named the
planet yeah i named it guacamole oh i
get it because it's green
yeah wait you know you're balding on the
back your head right yeah i know just
give me the thing all right here you go
go make it official thanks so what do we
do now that you have your own planet

to get there oh we do cody oh yes we do
what all right cody bam there's the
rocket ship junior that's not a rocket
ship it's a firework no it's a rocket

put it on the non-explode mode
what junior if you want to see a rocket
explode come over to my house tonight so
who's the first person that wants to go
to guacamole dude why don't you go it's
your planet well i would love to but i'm
not selfish

me dude go to your planet
yeah you could be the first person on
guacamole dude i am so honored i didn't
think i would ever
be anything in life well now you are you
will be the first person
you can look at the history books and
they will say joseph his friend from
school

my picture in the history books your
face
plastered all over times square the
first kid on guacamole dude i'll do it
okay i'll strap you to the firework i'm
gonna shoot you off okay
all right joseph you're about to be the
first person on guacamole you're a brave
astronaut
what are you gonna do when you get there
get my chips in it
dude this is gonna be the best thing
ever i'm gonna tell my kids about this
he's not gonna be able to tell his kids
because he's gonna die whoa hey
wait watch your mouth why would you wish
that upon him yeah why would you do that
dude
i'm not wishing it i'm just saying
that's what's gonna happen what do you
think would happen if they would have
told nemo if he touched the butt that
they would take him
he they did tell him that and he did it
anyway and look what happened
you're not making any sense just get out
of here just get out of here all right
joseph i'm going to light you
cody go go just let him slit he's going
to die
and he's dead look did he make it no he
didn't make it
yeah he made like a landing style go
come on come on all right cody let's see
if joseph's on guacamole he's not
because he died
cody what guacamole's missing what do
you mean look
junior where'd it go i don't know do you
think we blew up guacamole with our
firework
no junior it's a firework there's no way
it could have gone high enough oh
do you think aliens destroy guacamole i
don't know junior let's just call nasa
let's call that hey guys what's up the
stars
i don't get it well anyway my planet's
missing really yeah we were trying to
send my friend to my new planet
on a firework and and we think that we
might have accidentally blown up my
planet with a firework
or aliens destroyed it but show me look
look
look oh my god it's missing yeah i know
what do you think happened to it i don't
know did you move the telescope no we
didn't move it
do you think aliens destroyed the planet
those
dang aliens i gotta alert the news
[Music]
breaking news okay the newly discovered
planet
guacamole has been assumed to be
destroyed by aliens
the world has yet to decide the
punishment for this act
so kid what do you want to do your plan
is going i want revenge
on those stupid dumb ugly aliens because
my friend joseph died a hero
he died trying to go land on guacamole
so i want revenge on the aliens and i
want to nuke him i want you guys to send
100 nukes in every direction in space
until we hit those aliens
okay we don't really know where the
aliens are they said that's why i want
you to shoot nukes everywhere make the
biggest nuke in the world and nuke all
of our space
okay i'm gonna have to confess something
here
uh it was a booger what you're playing
it
it was a booger a booger yeah it was a
bugger on the lens of the telescope it
was not a planet
what are you talking about now i'm
saying that somebody picked their nose
and wiped it on your telescope and you
thought it was a planet but it was just
a booger
how long did you know this oh i knew as
soon as i saw it but you know i thought
you know it'd be funny to just kind of
play along and you know you thought you
made some kind of big scientific
discovery so
i thought it'd be kind of funny to tell
you you discovered a planet but then
then you strapped your friend to a
rocket and he's dead now so now i'm kind
of worried about the repercussions that
might have for me in my career
so i'm telling you this because i think
we should all just pretend this never
happened
and then just tell everyone that aliens
did it
okay now you think about it joseph
didn't even really need to go on a
rocket he had just flown up because he
had wings
