sound kind of silly but you know how
there's an election today yeah
yeah well we lost the other guy what do

like gone now
okay so then why are you here well i'm
here to try to find somebody who wants
to run for president and try to beat
trump in this election and i was kind of
hoping that'd be you
me why me because you're mario everybody
loves you
you know they recognize you from the
games a little bit like oh it's that guy
well i can't run for president because i
wasn't born in america oh
okay what about you i'm from outer space
what okay is anybody here from america
right here well how old are you 16. uh
okay we just won't tell anyone well no
jeffy cannot run for president well look
he's the best i have right now
um i'm gonna say something if i poop in
the strainer
it makes poop spaghetti see look he
cannot be president of the country no
it'll work okay okay jeffy uh come with
me you're gonna go debate the president
okay
no no hello and welcome to the
presidential debate
tonight we have president donald trump
versus
jeffy all right i'm going to ask both of
you questions
so just answer those as best you can mr
president we'll start with you
why should you be re-elected president
so
they should elect me president because
i'm already president and i'm
already living in the white house okay
and so if they didn't re-elect me it
would take me
approximately like four years to move
all my knickknacks and paddy wax and
give a dog a burn
out of the white house it would take
billions
upon billions of boxes to get all of my
stuff
out of there so to make it easier on me
donald j trump you should just re-elect
me president
so i don't have to move all my stuff out
of the office
all right now jeffy your turn same
question
why should you be elected president
wrong
mr president plea please don't interrupt
he hasn't even said anything so he can't
be wrong yet
you should vote for me for president
because if i was president
i would ban all school no kid would ever
have to go to school
ever again and they get to stay home and
play video games
all day also i would ban green beans and
make them illegal
because you're disgusting and icky and i
hate green
first of all no one should
ban green beans because no one
has done more for green beans than
i donald j trump since
the jolly green giant shut up green
beans
need to be banned because they're
disgusting and
they're shaped like little green pepes
wrong
carrots are better wrong no one likes
green
all beans all right all right break it
up you two all right we're gonna go on
to the next question
now jeffy in your opinion what is the
biggest problem in the world
right now the biggest problem in the
world right now
is fortnite every time they update the
seasons it gets worse and worse
to be honest i don't even recognize the
game anymore
so let's make fortnite great again
oh you actually like the dumb updates
all right all right all right
okay mr president same question what do
you think is the biggest problem in the
world right now
okay so the biggest problem in the world
right now is that legos
are too small okay this causes a choking
hazard
for billions upon billions of children
every single day okay so what i'm
proposing
is is that we make these tiny
puny little legos huge okay
we're going to call them huge blocks
okay
so so kind of like mega bloks i'm sorry
what
mega bloks oh mega bloks yes that's
exactly what i would call them
mega bloks because we would be making
america great again one block at a time
no no they're called mega bloks oh
oh yes this right here is exactly what
i'm talking about
so if you notice to show you guys a
little bit of a diagram
this is our border wall with the
previous administration
and this is our border wall with my
administration the trump administration
so yeah and also these are the exact
same blocks
that i want the border wall around the
moon
to be built out of so the world
will be huge i actually like the tiny
legos the big ones are for babies
mr president could you please stop
saying wrong
all right that is it for the
presidential debate
okay you know what whatever i'm going
home we're just gonna see who wins
tonight
there's no way jeffy wins the election
tonight don't say that mario we have to
believe in him
i don't believe nobody would vote for
him hey hey did they announce one yet no
they're about to
oh good breaking news okay
the election results are in and the next
president of the united states
is jeffy what's that mean no way
he did it that crazy son of a gun
actually did it jeffy what are you gonna
do now that you're president
well first of all i get to poop wherever
i want
yes you can mr president and you also
get this the nuclear football what's
that well this will let you nuke just
about anything
well the first thing i'm going to nuke
is all the green bean farms
and all the schools no no jeffy no no
you can't do that because if you nuked
that you're going to nuke our country
and
we're all going to die well that's a
small price to pay for me to be happy
ah run for your life
goofy goober yeah
