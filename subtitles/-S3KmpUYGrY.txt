what are you doing here is your son home

used in the most brutal crime of this
generation wait what crime
somebody stole cookies from the cookie

impossible they said the cookie jar is
the most protected cookie jar in the
world
it's like guarded by a guard and a steel
door yeah well someone did it anyway and
this is the only clue i've got
what makes you think my son did it
because your son is a kid
and kids play with nerf guns and if he's
a kid
then he must have a nerf gun and this
bullet goes to a nerf gun
so this might be the bullet for your
kid's nerf gun no no i promised my son
wouldn't do that

such a heinous crime

cops here

was going inside of an officer's face
like you did at the cookie vault i
didn't do that oh yeah you got a nerf
gun
of course i do i gotta stay strapped in
case someone wants to run up on the
quack dealer let me see that
uh yeah the bullet wouldn't fit okay
