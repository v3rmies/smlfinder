chris brown because you sure beat it up
well no jeffy look
it's supposed to be a car that you can
you don't have to be afraid to wreck it
because you know if you run into stuff
you won't be worried
okay so when i drive it i can run in
your stuff and hit people whatever you
still can't hit people
running and stuff then why'd you buy me
a car and i was already beat up mario
new cars are safer and they have air

you hush your mouth
mario you couldn't have gotten him a
nicer car than that well i don't have
money just to drop on a new car all
right daddy well then we better not eat
ever again what does food have to do
with any of this well if we can't afford
a car
then we sure can't afford food and you
better turn off all these lines because
if we can't afford a new car
or food then we can't afford electricity
i have money for bills i just don't have
money for a new car well i bet you have
a car well i do but i have to drive
places
