it's just like it's just a piece of
paper
well what he'd get a stall i want to
stall don't worry about it just focus
okay he and his girlfriend are going to
come outside to look at the star
and when they do i want you to pretend
to steal his girlfriend's purse
then i'm going to come over and pretend
to beat you up and then she'll want to
be with me instead of him
because i'm a hero look at these abs but
uh
what if she doesn't have a purse mate
she'll have a purse she's a girl
but what if she doesn't have a puff
she'll have a purse okay
now just try to steal it and then
whenever i come over i'm gonna punch you
and then you act like i punched you
really hard like it was a super punch
okay

mario you didn't do anything well i was
gonna do something like i didn't know if
he had a knife or if he was gonna hurt
me like i tried to look for my phone so
i called 9-1-1 but
i didn't want to get hurt mario you just
stood there i was about to kick him
no all you did was just sit there and
cry like a little baby no no i was
totally gonna kick him
but then i didn't wanna i didn't know if
he was wearing a belt and i was gonna
hit the hard part and then stub my toe
well i'm glad super d was here because
he saved my life
oh come on babe you've had a pretty
rough night let's go in and lay down

might have a concussion
my head's fine i'm just a little shaken
up just let me know if you need
mouth-to-mouth
all right super dweeb you can leave i
got it from here hi daddy how'd the star

oh wait let me guess i better look like
a little white dot in the sky not right
now jeffy mario how could you just stand
there and do nothing
i was gonna do something i just didn't
want to step in yet i was counting three
mississippi because i thought you had
him had him he was twice my size
well you know i just you know i don't
want to step in because if i would have
hit him you know i don't want to hurt
him too bad
bruh just admit that you're too scrawny
i'm not scrawny look at this muscle
my thumb is bigger than your whole arm
well that may be true but i don't want
big arms big arms are gross
you don't like long arms mario i have
long arms i didn't say anything about
long arms i said big arms are gross bro
you're just really tiny you have no
muscles i'm not tiny i
got a lot of muscles i'm big daddy you
are pretty tiny i'm 16 and look how big
i am
i'm a big jeffy daddy you better watch
out wrong
i'm taller than you too well it doesn't
matter how short i am i'm still really
strong like i can beat people up like i
step on turtles
that's pretty messed up bro and i step
on caterpillars caterpillars
so you just stomp on stuff they can't
fight back wait i mean yeah
in my game i stepped on a lot of animals
i mean that's fine
look i can beat up people and if i saw
that robber again i'd punch him in the
face
and and he'd go blind because i punched
him so hard he'd go blind no really you
would
yeah yeah if i saw that robber again i'd
be like
like he would be like hurt he'd be
really hurt like i better not see his
face again
because because he'd get hurt put on him
really mario you would do that for me
yeah
i would do that for you baby i would
hurt him and and show you that i'm a man
you're really falling for this yes he
said he would save me and i believe him
yeah i would i i'd beat him up if i saw
him again i'd beat him up
okay well we'll see what happens next
time yeah yeah well there won't be a
next time cause we're never going
outside ever again we're gonna
sit here on this couch you know cause
i'm not tiny i'm a man
i i'll do anything with my baby you know
all right man i'm gonna need another
favor from you whoa whoa whoa
did you like how i reacted you hit me
earlier uh it was okay you could use a
little bit more practice
all right okay so for some reason she's
still with that lame guy from earlier
so i need you to break into their house
and then the guy says he can beat you up
but he can't so just you know try to
steal her purse again and
he might hit you a few times but just
pretend it doesn't hurt well what if it
hurts me
it's not gonna hurt he's pretty scrawny
he'll be fine all right well how do i
pretend that it's not gonna hurt right
i don't know just just don't flinch
you'll beat him up it's fine don't worry
about it
all right how do i get the house well
they don't lock the front door so just
you can just walk right in
all right but i'm on it mario would you
really ever fight that man if we saw him
again
oh yeah baby i would totally fight him
like i would totally protect you you
know because i'm a man and if i ever saw
him again i'd punch him right in the
face and
and beat him up he says i wasn't
prepared last time but now i'm totally
prepared
oh man i have to pee what i'll had to
pee so bad but mario you said you would
fight him i haven't peed like all day

i've had to call the bank numerous times
and they're like guy why do you keep
falling for this and i'm like i'm really
desperate man
i'm desperate too like i just want to be
really tall and have a bunch of muscles
and a six-pack abs
wait wait you want to be tall yeah i
want to be bigger like i want to be tall
and like
big muscles i want to be bigger oh
i thought you would well it doesn't
really matter what i thought but
i mean i i was talking about you being
tall too right like earlier like when i
was saying those things yeah we're
talking about tall right yeah we're
talking about tall
and muscles yeah muscles yeah oh well i
guess i'll just deal with
deal with what i got yeah hey dan i got
an idea what
what if you eat one of those mushrooms
from your game and then you get bigger
that way
what a big idea jeffy that's your big
idea
jeffy's big idea wow you know for a
minute there i thought mario's name was
going to be in the title i was getting
nervous
viewer retention was like now it's like
thanks for that big idea jeffy well how
are we going to do jeffy's big idea like
i need a mushroom for my game i don't
know that exists well uh i i know a guy
i went to college with that could
probably hook you up with some mushrooms
you uh you want to meet them yeah let's
go meet them okay
hey you mario oh yeah a brown guy said
supposed to meet you about some
mushrooms yeah i heard you want to get
big oh yeah i want to get real big
okay i can hook you up i got this whoa
what is that
that's a mushroom now it's going to do
one of two things it's going to either
make you big or it's going to make you
eat someone's face and talk to chairs
well i really hope it makes me big yeah
i hope so too for your sake well how big
is it gonna make me
i don't know like twice your size twice
my size that's still not that big
ah okay okay i can make you bigger i
also have this
whoa what is that now that's a mega
mushroom it'll either make you
really really big or it'll make you want
to eat 10 people's faces and talk to
trees
okay well i really hope it makes me
really really big yeah well what i would
recommend is you take the small one
first and if that doesn't work you take
the big one okay a deal
i'll be really safe with it all right be
careful all right
i got the stuff so how's this supposed
to work he says if i eat this one it'll
either make me bigger
or maybe you want to eat people's faces
oh okay
i'll just wash them back here all right
so i just eat it
i guess all right here i go
anything happening oh me your face i'm
just joking with you oh
geez you had me there i haven't ate it
yet all right here i go
oh am i bigger whoa yeah yeah you're
about as big as me
that's not big enough super d is huge
what super d what i thought we were
talking about height all right so
