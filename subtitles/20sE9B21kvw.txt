marvin it's wrong what wrong schmom
breaking news okay someone has stolen
the sign off of a taco bell and no one
can tell what restaurant it is the
police are holding a live press
conference now let's go to that thanks
goodman as you can see from this picture
here this is a taco bell i think see i
don't know because there's no sign out
front because somebody stole it you know
so restaurants have signs in front of
them so that you know where you're going
but now nobody knows what's going on
customers keep coming into the taco bell
and they're ordering baconators thinking
it's wendy's or something and the
workers don't know what's going on
either they're in there trying to make
big macs with burrito supplies it's
chaos so listen up whoever stole that
sign we're coming for you oh no marvin i
don't want any part of this illegal
activity i'm leaving for a couple of
days what baby no come back
jeffy what are you doing oh i'm just
polishing my brand new taco bell shine i
love it so much well you better love it
