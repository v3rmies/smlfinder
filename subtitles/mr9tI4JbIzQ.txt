thank you here's ken but he's spoken for
okay well my name's mr goodman and i'm
the attorney representing this case may
i ask you a few questions ken
he says yes okay well do you happen to
know a lady by the name of barquisha
jones
no okay well what about poof ball tina
poof no we don't know who that is okay
we got one more here and her name is
jessica do you know jessica
no who are these women well all three of
these women claim to have had a child
with kin and here are the children right
here
no no no
no no no no
okay stop playing star wars this is
serious all right how about we ask
ken ken do you know these women can can
be honest baby we can get through
anything
did you appoint these ladies um
by a silence i already know the answer
but that smile he knows exactly what he
did
no no no ken just wants to plead the
fifth okay well a simple dna test would
prove whether ken is or is not the
father so
do you mind if i collect a dna sample
out of me or him well him would be
preferable
okay well give us a few minutes i need
some privacy well i can just do it
oh you want a piece too oh what a
coincidence that the day before my
wedding to the man of my
dreams all of these bimbos show up and
now they all water peas
well let's just get the dna sample going
and we'll be good to go
fine so cody do you think ken's the
father of any of these kids
no junior the kids don't even look like
him but i understand why the women would
want to lie about it ken
is a lawyer astronaut doctor scientist
that plays for the nba so he does have
millions
can't really blame him for wanting to
check but you know we'll have all the
answers soon enough
all right i got the results back and it
turns out that i'm 100
rich yeah that's actually my bank
statement but anyway i did get the dna
test back
and ken you are the father
cody you're not going to stay with him
no no i thought i was with a real man
who liked mad not stupid stinky girls
who have
axe woods in their pants i'm gonna go
eat a whole can of vienna sausages and
think about how
cat used to taste it's so good man
what's gonna happen with ken now
well ken owes all these women thousands
of dollars in back child support so he
better get to work
wanna go check on cody
are you okay cody yeah yeah yeah i'm
great i i don't even miss can at all no
i have a new boyfriend now you already
have a new boyfriend yeah yeah this is
joe and hey check this out
his mouth moves junior ken's mouth
couldn't move
the possibilities are endless he can do
things ken couldn't even dream of doing
that that's really cool but are you sure
you don't want to give ken a second
chance
no no i'm done with ken i don't need him
why well because because he cheated on
me and he has three kids now well maybe
he didn't cheat on you maybe he had the
kids before he met
you dunya those kids were babies i met
ken seven years ago those kids weren't
seven years old that means he cheated on
me
well well maybe he just made a mistake
no junior it's not a mistake if you do
it three times that's called a habit
well what about the third time's a charm
thing that's with good things not
kids oh well i just you and ken dated
for so long and
and i don't really like joe that much oh
come on junior did i not show you the
mouth thing i mean hey check this out
hey hey joe would you ever cheat on me
no cody i never cheat on you
and if i did it would be with a big
hunky dude and then you could join
would you like to do that cody oh yeah
i'd love that joe that's a great idea
well look how about i go get ken and
then maybe he'll change your mind no no
don't bring him into this
hey ken let's go talk to cody he's
acting crazy wait joseph what are you
doing
uh nothing who's this oh it's salty
paprika
where'd you get her from oh i got him
from target wait a minute
what did you buy all these dolls oh
dang it dude you got me look don't tell
cody but he made me mad
when he didn't make me his best man so i
went to target and i bought all these
dogs to make him look like king got him
pregnant
joseph that's mean i know it's mean but
dude he made me mad when he didn't make
me his best man but you made him cry
he made me cry i was in the bathroom
tearing up and then he didn't even check
on me
well we have to go tell cody the truth
no we don't dude look if he stays mad
again
look we won't ever have to see ken again
you're right
cody needs to grow up and he needs to
get rid of ken anyway so this is the
best way to get rid of ken
exactly we won't tell them the truth so
just just so that he gets rid of this
doll
hey guys oh hey cody oh hey dude yeah me
and my new boyfriend joe are gonna break
up because he has a brain tumor and i
didn't sign up for that
so i'll just take ken and his kids wait
you're actually gonna accept ken's kids
well yeah i thought about it i do love
ken
well he has another one dude yeah yeah
he has another kid you don't know about
she it just popped out
ooh ouch well that's okay what's one
more at this point right
me and ken were gonna adapt anyway and
at least now they can have his perfect
jeans
so you're really gonna take care of all
of ken's kids yep i'm gonna raise him
like my own family and take him with me
wherever i go
take him with you wherever you go yep
every time i come over here i'm gonna
have to bring all of them
okay dude i did all this look i was mad
at you for not making me your best man
so i went to target and i bought all
these beautiful ladies to make it look
like ken got him pregnant

take these back to the store
and get my money back don't forget the
