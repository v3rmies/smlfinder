daddy you're never getting into my phone
no matter who you are
jay what is the passcode of your phone
dad i'm not giving you my password

phone we're gonna get your phone jeffy
you're never getting into my phone you
big baldy come on baby

this is getting ridiculous i want to
know what's on the phone
all right officer i need your help get
inside this iphone okay whose phone is
it it's my son's wait so it's stolen no
it's not stolen i bought it so
technically it's mine i just need your
help getting inside it well why don't
you just have your son open it
huh i didn't think about that oh wait
maybe because i already asked him and he
said no
well maybe you should respect his
privacy then well i think there might be
some
illegal activities happening on this
phone oh really
okay that's cool all right you know the
police academy taught us a special way
of getting into iphones just like this
really oh yeah you're gonna love this
it's a secret technique that not a lot
of people know about
check this out one one one one nope
two two two two nope three three
three three nope four four four four
no what are you doing i'm trying every
number one at a time to see if i can
guess the combination
i could do that look that would take
forever well there's ten thousand
combinations and if it takes me two
seconds each try then that's about five
and a half hours come on you slow me
down
mario you need to respect jeffy's
privacy hey hey i've been locked out
i've been locked out for one minute so
we're just gonna have to sit here and
wait
have you ever done this before oh yeah i
did this to get my ex-wife's phone you
know because i thought she was cheating
on me oh it was totally worth it i got
in there
the things i saw led to a divorce you
know i didn't know they could actually
get that big like i thought that was
photoshop but they do
they do get big i mean it made me feel
pretty insecure but you know good for
them
is there any faster way to get in this
phone well the fastest way would be if
you knew the passcode do you know the
passcode no i don't know the back that i
wouldn't call you if i knew it
okay okay fine i'm just asking any other
fast ways to get in it well uh
the iphone does have like face id so if
we print out a picture of your son's
face and show the camera it might open
really yeah okay let's do that then to
the printer
uh-huh uh-huh bingo back to the couch
all right check this out hey daddy it's
me jeffy
you think the phone's gonna buy that i
don't know try it all right let's find
out
here we go just gotta wake the phone up
all right one one one
one nope two two two two wait did not
detect his face yeah yeah i know okay so
what do we do now
oh okay i have an idea how about you go
into jeffy's room when he's sleeping
tonight and then you go up to him yeah
yeah and then you cut off his face
and then you let me wear it and show it
to the phone no no i thought you were
gonna say while he's sleeping we take
the phone up to his face and
unlock it oh yeah yeah that's a much
better idea and way less illegal okay
we're gonna do that then
mario stop it i wanna get inside this
phone so while you're sleeping tonight
you're gonna walk up to him you're gonna
do it me why me because you're a cop
you're all stealth and stuff
