all right crafts today
you're going to be doing a partner
project essay so you
and one partner are going to be writing
a 500 pound essay
on why bubble wrap is so poppy
wait a 500 pound essay don't you mean a
500 page essay
no 500 pound essay and this
is like one pound so 500 of these with
500 pounds that's like 500 000 pages
nobody in the world could do that
that's why you're gonna get a partner
see it says it on the board
partner project are you stupid you have
eyes you have four of them use them and
look at the board
you're gonna get 250 pounds and your
partner gonna get 250 pounds does it
make sense
now no it doesn't make sense because
even with a partner that would take
years to complete so now i'm going to
assign the partners
cody you're paired with joseph
i got the smartest nerdy class as my
partner i'm going to get an a
