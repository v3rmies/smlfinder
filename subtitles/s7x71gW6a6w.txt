from your friend oh well here's the
packaging right here
magic grow capsules mario you need one
of those
it grows into animals it says not a food
product jeffy you're not supposed to eat
this
it says do not place in mouth or swallow
rosaline have you been reading this
huh jeffy you have to spit that out and
throw it up because it might be
poisonous so throw up
all right daddy i'll try
yeah yeah i tried throwing up like a
kitty cat
jeffy you said you didn't throw up now i
have to call a doctor because you might
be poisoned from this magic grow capsule
let me call a doctor hey there somebody
call a doctor yes doctor my son
swallowed something and i don't know if
it's poisonous oh no did he swallow a
rattlesnake because that wouldn't be
poisonous that'd be venomous there's a
difference why would he swallow a
rattlesnake
i don't know but did he no oh he
swallowed one of these magic grow
capsules oh yeah that makes way more
sense than swallowing a rattlesnake
he did not swallow rattlesnake look look
is this poisonous or not well it's not
venomous i can tell you that is it
poisonous
i don't know what's the box saying it
says do not place in mouth or swallow
has my wife been reading that i already
made that joke oh
flame so what's gonna happen to jeffy if
he swallowed one of these well
i don't know i guess we'll just find out
what animal he swallowed when he poops
it out
i hope he swallowed a sheep because that
would be bad
you get it i said bad
you know because sheeps they go they go
bad yeah yeah i get it i get it so
so you don't think it's poisonous you
think he's gonna be okay yeah i mean i
guess
um i've also been eating cat poop okay
now that that that that is actually bad
for you don't do that yeah tell them no
no no cat poop well they look like
ferrero rochers like where they're
crunchy on the outside but creamy in the
middle
i don't know what that is i know what
that is they're good okay look look
so so i will call you if things get
worse but you don't think anything bad
can happen no i think it'll be fine
all right so mario do you think jeffy's
going to be okay
well nothing's happened to him yet so i
think we're gonna be fine
what's wrong daddy uh uh you're a sheep
oh no rosalina this is bad
what are we gonna do i'm so scared today
i'm gonna sheep my pants jeffy is that
really you are you pulling the wool over
our eyes
we have to call the doctor back ow
hey daddy you should spank my fluffy
cheeks
[Laughter]
we call the doctor hey there you know i
don't even go home
i just wait out my car because i know
you're going to call me again i'm sorry
that's fine gas ain't cheap but next
time i'll just sit in your living room
and then go through your pantry and get
a snack or something
well you won't believe what happened
jeffy turned into a sheep
isn't that bad yeah that's bull crap
it happened like he really did turn into
a sheep what no people don't just turn
into animals because they eat a magic
growing sponge well
you were right like he ate the sheep one
and he turned into a sheep
what do you think it was born yesterday
you think i'm actually going to believe
that
it actually did happen like jeffy talk
talk no no no seriously it's my son he
can talk
he has the helmet you see all right hold
on let me get my cop outfit on before i
accuse you of anything wait what
all right here's what i think happened i
think you wanted to get rid of your son
like so you went to the store and you
bought those magical sponge growing
tablets and then he ate one
and then you called me because you
thought he was gonna
because you thought i wanted hold on
hold on i'm confused
there was a mollusk and a sea cucumber
what i'm sorry i watched finding nemo
earlier
let's restart you wanted to get rid of
your son so you did it
and then you replaced him with a sheep
and you put a helmet on the sheep
because you thought no one would notice
why would i do that well because it's
easier to take care of a sheep than to
take care of your son
that is the stupidest thing i ever heard
of that's actually my son he turned into
a sheep and i'll prove it
jeffy talk jeffy
hold on just give me a second jeffy i
swear to god if you don't talk i'm
taking away all your toys
but daddy you gotta buy me the
playstation 5 and then i'll talk
what buy me the playstation 5 or i'm
gonna keep going
shut up you're yelling shut up at a
sheep no it's not a sheep it's my son
look
i promise it's my son look he has the
blue helmet well yeah anybody could put
a helmet on a sheep
he'll say his name jeffy say your name
just say your name sheep
what sheep that's clearly my son because
sheeps don't say sheep
of course they do they like pokemon they
say their own name all the time
no they don't look this is my son i
don't want to get rid of my son
if i want to get rid of him i would just
get rid of him so you really expect me
to believe that your son ate a sponge
and now now he's a sheep or something
yes that's exactly what happened
i'm not crazy he says that he'll talk if
i get him a playstation 5.
do you hear yourself you sound
delusional it's true
this is my son that's really him i would
not get rid of him you are
insane i mean do you have anybody who
could back up your crazy story oh oh
baby uh-huh yeah didn't jeffy turn into
a sheep
oh yeah uh-huh he's he's telling the
truth where is she
i think she's doing her nails in the
closet what look look that's my son
jeffy i look that's him right there okay
i'm not buying this and i don't know
what kind of insurance fraud thing
you're trying to run here so i'm gonna
go and i'm gonna get a warrant for your
arrest and if you don't have your son
here when i get back
you're going to jail what hey mario
what's going on
baby i might go to jail no it's your
turn
the cop thinks that i got rid of jeffy
and replaced them with a sheep well
that's preposterous
you shut up oh hi my name is jeffy is
that what you wanted me to say daddy are
you happy
i'm gonna kill him i'm gonna kill him
just do that when the cop gets back okay
daddy when the cop gets back on yo help
what the hell
shut up look there's only one person
that i know that can fix
all this because jeffy has to be a human
by the time the cop gets back
who's that mario hold on oh yeah
god why do you hate me ugh you complain
a lot
i'm so glad you're here look i have a
huge problem yeah you always do
and i need you to fix it okay so look my
son turned into a sheep
well that is different yeah so so the
cops think you know i
got rid of them oh oh bro bro hold on i
have to stop you for one second i gotta
tell you a story oh man this one time i
was playing truth or dare with this guy
named abraham
and i dared him to sacrifice his son and
the crazy dude almost did it
really oh yeah like he was ready to do
it like he had him on the table and
everything and it was like at the last
minute i had to be like bro bro bro
stop stop it's just a game you know like
you could pass you could pick truth you
don't really have to do it but
he was just too ready to sacrifice his
son like he was thinking about it before
i told him to you know
it's crazy yeah you should be in jail
you can't do that it must have been a
long
awkward walk home you know dad were you
really gonna sacrifice me
yeah why because god told me to if god
told you to jump off a bridge would you
do that
i bet he would guys nuts i should tell
him to jump off a bridge
