Wendy's
life order order order order I Am The
Honorable Jorge bber and today we will
be hearing the case of Ronald McDonald
who is suing Wendy's for stealing his
purple Grimace Shake idea and trying to
sell it as a purple frost a Mr McDonald
let's hear your side of the
case oh you please help me I was at a
homeless shelter giving away free
cheeseburgers to homeless pregnant women
with AIDS when all of a sudden I see
this commercial for Wendy's come on and
they're bragging about stealing my
Grimace Shake they're wanted a purple
Frosty is some they're stealing
money from me Yana Wendy is a greeny
idea stealing Miss Wendy's is this
true did you steal the grimma shake idea
from McDonald's no your honor I make my
famous chocolate flavored frosties and
then I decided it might be fun to make a
purple Berry flavored Frosty oh my S one
year to the day that I made my grimy
shck you stupid i d stealing SL order
order order order settle down Mr
McDonald now miss windy it has been
exactly one year since the Grimace Shake
was released so it is kind of suspicious
that you would release a purple Frosty
your honor he doesn't own The Color
Purple okay now you start to selling my
Manion that's like if you were suing me
for selling cheeseburgers he doesn't own
Burgers either actually you know what
you're now I want to sue Pella
cheeseburgers
too oh got me sounding like a damn
turkey Mr McDonald Wendy is right you do
not own the rights to the color purple
and you do not own the rights to cheese
burgers now it is true Wendy may have
copied your idea for a purple Shake but
that does not count as copyright
infringement so I have to find Wendy not
guilty of copyright infringement this
case is closed yes oh this is
you're this is BFF have Mr
McDonald's removed from my courtroom
 you're out this is absolute H
 come on buddy time to go you'll Ru
the day Wendy's don't Ru the day Wendy's
nuts oh hell no I'll be
let's go let's go thank you so much your
honor for finding me not guilty now hold
on Wendy because I still have another
lawsuit against you on my desk you are
being sued by two kids who claim to have
found a bread clip in their
Baconator what Junior and cod please
explain what you found well your honor
we were eating our baconators for bacon
ater Wednesday and then I saw a bread
clip in my burger and I was like damn I
can't eat that yeah it's true I saw the
whole thing your honor they could have
put that bread clip in the burger just
to get an easy check from me just like
the lady who put the finger in the
chilly the bingo was me come on big
guy this is true Junior and Cody do you
have any proof you didn't put the bread
clip in the burger yourself yes your
honor there are multiple other posts
online from people who've also found
this exact looking bread clip in their
burgers from Wendy's H very interesting
well Wendy I find you guilty of putting
bread clips and burgers and I order you
to pay these two kids
$2,000 for mouth reconstruction surgery
if they need it from biting into that
bread clip what our mouths are fine we
didn't even bite it we just want them to
stop putting bread Clips in their
burgers also you didn't bang the gavel
thing so does it does it count oh yeah
bam it's done there go so Cody what are
you going to do with your $10,000 well
I'm not going to buy Wendy's I'll tell
you that yeah I mean I don't understand
how a bread CL got into a burger I know
and that many times too it wasn't just
us it was a lot of people yeah I don't
understand how you take the clip off the
bread and it just falls into the burger
between the patties it was between the
patties too how does that happen you
have to put a Patty down and then and
then you have to do whatever causes the
bread clip to fall and then it goes
right in the burger and you just put
another Patty on top of that you don't
even notice I don't understand guys like
this whole video is about the Ronald
McDonald thing and then we got the intro
like last and then we saw the bread clip
and then we had to make a whole story
behind that because that actually
happened yeah so watch out yeah good
thing we only order it for the scene
good thing we weren't eating it yeah no
we didn't take a bite but like you know
if you're getting Wy just you know check
check for bread Clips
yeah Square
