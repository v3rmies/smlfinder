not really i guess it's kind of serious
so uh you know how there's candy and
everybody likes candy well there's this
one factory that makes all the candy in
the world and like it has a lot of
machines obviously and most of them make
candy but there is one of the machines
that does make rat poison and yeah so
there was like a little little teeny
tiny little bit of a mix up at the
factory and now there's rat poison in
all the candy all of it all over the
world so if you eat the candy you're
gonna die so just you know i mean don't
eat the candy like it's not that hard
just don't eat the candy and you'll be
okay and if you've already eaten the
candy you you're gonna die i'm sorry but
like i mean just don't eat it right if
you so if you go on trick-or-treating
just don't don't eat any of the candy
right okay good oh man that is the
hardest thing i've ever had to do oh no
it's a good thing we didn't need any
candy
dude i just ate my earhead what an
airhead junior this is serious he's
gonna die well quick joseph throw up

word avocado in it i avocad don't know
oh come on laugh where i'm leaving
do we call a doctor well junior there's
no point in calling a doctor millions of
people are going to be dying tonight so
we should just bury him in the backyard
like a dog
okay poor joseph oh come on buddy
we just buried joseph yeah it was too
graphic to show a pack of wolves
attacked us while we were burying him
and stole one of joseph's legs yeah they
got one of his eyes too we we put some
band-aids on it i mean even though he's
dead we just felt bad yeah poor joseph
he didn't have to cut him open and steal
one of his kidneys though we can get a
lot of money on those on the black
market the brains uh
what's that sound i don't know
hey
because i buddy a brain
do something
okay i have these scissors stopping the
brain
hey zombie
wait is it that stop again
one more time
one more time
okay i think he's dead now yeah i think
he's definitely dead
he's a zombie
oh my god how'd he turn into a zombie
look junior the news
[Music]
breaking news okay there is another
reason for you not to eat the halloween
candy that's even worse than the first
reason let's go to the emergency press
conference now hey hey hey there me
again hey so uh somehow the situation
get worse can you believe it yeah so uh
remember earlier when i told you about
the rat poison in the candy because of
the mix up at the factory well uh it
turns out that there was actually a
nuclear power plant in the factory where
they make the candy and the rat poison
so the candy is also radioactive so if
you eat the candy you're gonna die and
come back as a zombie
yeah so again just don't eat the candy
but now there are zombies everywhere
because everybody who's eating the candy
is dying they're turning into zombies
and so that's that's gonna be a problem
but you know just just you know be
careful and don't eat the candy and
watch out for the zombies um i'm gonna
go hide you've got to be kidding me wait
so that means everybody who eats candy
is gonna die and then turn into a zombie
junior we need weapons to defend
ourselves from the zombie apocalypse

make sure nobody eats candy
