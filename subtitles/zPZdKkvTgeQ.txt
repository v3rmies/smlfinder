cereal that's worth dying for
yeah let's munch let's get to munching
wait wait hold on
let me turn on the tv so i can watch tv
while we eat hey there i'm the head of
marketing for the hit
cereal cookie crisp now here at cookie
crisp we're looking for a new catchy
jingle to sell our cereal because it
turns out telling people it's cookies
for breakfast
is making parents not want to give the
cereal to their kids so
i am personally offering my ps5 to
anybody who comes up with a new catchy
jingle for our cereal
now i know what you're thinking why am i
up here asking you to make a jingle for
me
well that's because my boss has given me
until tomorrow to come up with one and
well i'm kind of stuck i can't really
think of anything so if you could help
me out
that'd be great and i'll give you a ps5
whoa
joseph huh stop eating your cereal like
a woodpecker oh my bad dude it's a bad
habit why'd you even bring this spoon
guys we could win a playstation 5. we
could all win one well
one what i mean we could win one
no no we we're going to win a
playstation 5 but we haven't won a place
in five yet
well when we win we will have one one
you don't have to say one twice
if we win we'll win one no i mean we
won't all win one
yes we will that's what we're trying to
do we're trying to win one okay we're
not even gonna win so it doesn't matter
all right guys we gotta think of a
catchy slogan for cookie crisp
dude i got one well what is it five
dollar
five dollar cookie crush oh i like that
i like that and then they can sell
cookers for five dollars exactly
no no guys guys we can't do that
somebody already did that what well you
know they had that song that was like
five dollar five dollar foot long what
no no no no no no sure i just thought of
it yeah subway didn't do that
yeah they did they did it like years ago
what okay foot long just sounds like
something you want
right oh i got i got it you can't out
cookie crisp the hut
dude that's genius right no that's just
pizza hut wait no it's not well pizza
hut
is you can't out pizza to hide no way
yeah well i just thought that on my own
i was like you can't out cookie crisp
the hood
you didn't think of that because why
else would you say hi well why does
pizza get a hut well because they're
called pizza hut well what if we call
ours cookie crypt hud well that's not
the name of the company it's just
okay you can't out cookie the crisp what
what junior hello that's too similar
we're gonna get sued no it's too similar
like yeah okay so then why doesn't uh
the color orange through the color red
junior that doesn't even make sense no
no the colors look really similar so why
don't they see each other because
they're similar yeah they know how to
get along
yeah but they're not if colors can get a
wrong then companies get along
okay you know what fine guys why doesn't
aquafina sue dasani
they both sell water it looks the same
tall but they're not stealing each
other's ideas for slogans
well no we're saying cookie crisps we're

can't just keep stealing
magic guys i don't want to have any part
of this i'm leaving they're magically
delicious
silly rabbit cookie cruises for
breakfast
all right guys i just sent the song to
the contest dude we're totally gonna win
oh we're definitely gonna win joseph hey
yeah dude are we gonna win cody no we're
gonna get sued because this song's
illegal
illegal but oh you're saying the song is
so good it should be illegal because
after people hear it queen chris is
going to sell billions and billions of
blocks of cereal and make trillions of
dollars and it should be illegal to have
that much money yeah
totally no it's illegal because we stole
ideas from a bunch of other companies
we didn't steal ideas look joseph is a
lyrical genius and every lyric in this
song was 100 original right joseph yeah
100 original came off the dome i thought
of it like right off the dome like the
lyric
i'm cookie crisp like joseph thought of
that yeah dude i just thought of it i
don't know how i thought of it it just
came to me yeah
it just came to him you thought of it
because you heard it in a mcdonald's
commercial
oh okay okay what about the we have the
meats yeah that's from arby's
no it's not we thought of that
originally right joseph yeah it just
came to me in a dream dude
yeah we have the meat sometimes i leave
my tv on you know when i fall asleep but
it didn't come to me in a dream
yeah why would you even say you had
meats there's no meat in cookie crisp
no no it's not about meat being in the
cookie crisp it's about you know like
when you eat a lot of cookie crisps you
get really fat
so you have a lot of meat on your body
so you have the meats on your body for
eating a lot of good crisps yeah
guys okay whatever when we get sued i
don't want to have any part of this okay
well you basically had no part of this
because
you didn't think of anything like you
held the camera so you have like one
percent of effort like you get you get
one percent of credit for this
commercial
oh guys guys that could be the ps5 oh
dude or a lawyer
oh hello congratulations you won the ps5
yeah you made my job a lot easier here
you go oh my god thank you so much
yes cody we got a ps5 yeah we did
no way yes way no thanks to you i i held
the camera
you did like one percent of effort so
you get to play it for like one minute
oh dude i want to play it right now well
i want to play it right now well dude i
should play it first i wrote the song
well i sang the song
well i am the song because i wrote it
everybody's going to remember the lyrics
well
it wouldn't have been a hit if it wasn't
for my beautiful voice singing it no
nobody cares about your voice it's the
lyrics dude okay how about this how
about this joseph how about this
how about for the first six months of
the year i get to keep the system at my
house
and for the second six months of the
year you can keep it at your trailer no
that's not fair i want to play it now
okay well can you think of a better
reason um how about we
flip a coin for it and if it lands on
tails i get to take it to my house
trailer
whatever and if it lands on heads you're
gonna keep it at your house well that
does seem fair
wait what about me i helped what about
you well i did hold the camera
okay how about this hold this hold this
if it lands on heads
i get to keep it at my house if it lands
on tails joseph gets to take it to his
trailer
and if it lands perfectly on the edge
like this like not head to our tails we
just land
right on the edge you get to take it to
your house oh come on that'll never
happen
yeah because you did like nothing so you
should get like the least amount of
chance to keep at your house yeah i
think that's fair
i think it's fair too so i'm gonna flip
it
up it went behind the couch let's go
let's go look okay all right joseph
where's it at uh
right there dude yes no way
it's a miracle no it's a nightmare
there's no way it landed like that oh
okay okay new rule it has to land on a
hard surface like that no no you didn't
say that junior this counts
i didn't say that no you didn't say that
dude so i guess it's fair it's not fair
look
it landed like that on carpet so so
technically it's like it's like
it's like it's faulty you know we got to
redo it no no junior landed the way you
said so now i get to keep the ps5 but
but you didn't do anything i sang the
song i put my heart and soul into it
what your heart is sold in the lyrics
you didn't write
look guys if you want to play it you can
just come over to my house with a cody
well you better set it up right because
we're playing it tonight and i'm going
to play all night at your house
so set it up right you're not going to
play before me
