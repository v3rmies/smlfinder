just go and see if you have something in
your kitchen okay let me go see
all right joseph i had some bleach all
right dude get the pouring okay so i
only poured on the stain right oh no no
no dude pour it on the entire couch you
don't want it to look uneven
oh yeah you don't want one part of the
couch to look cleaner than the rest of
the couch
exactly okay we're gonna make this thing
look brand new okay so i just pour it
everywhere yeah yeah get the pouring
dude
there we go that's what i've done oh
yeah yeah yeah
all right joseph i just poured bleach
all over the whole couch all right dude
let it sit for five minutes and it'll
look brand new
all right oh oh joseph
yeah dude why is the couch pink
oh what oh dude you're gonna laugh about
this
what but they use bleach to clean white
clothes
what's that mean they use bleach to
clean white clothes they make clothes
whiter
then why do we pour it on a red couch
look i knew it was a cleaning product i
just didn't know what it was used to
clean
look i knew they used it on toilets my
couch is not a toilet
but but look i didn't know that you were
going to use it on your couch
yesterday you told me to use it on my
couch i just knew i was going to clean
something okay dude
okay look look what do we do now like
like like well
when my dad sees this he's gonna ground
me he wants it to be red
dude your dad is so old he probably has
alzheimer's she probably thinks the
couch is blue
oh no no he knows his couch is red and
if this couch isn't red by the time he
comes back he's going to burn all my
toys and put me up for adoption
dude being an orphan's not that bad look
at me
i don't want to be poor okay look okay
i'm going to call a doctor
wait wait what is his doctor going do
well well the couch looks sick right
it's pale right
uh i guess so yes and you call the
doctor when you're pale and sick so i'm
gonna call a doctor all right hopefully
you could fix it hey there you call a
doctor
oh i like this nice new pink couch looks
very clean
anyway why'd you call me well doctor my
couch is pink yeah i know i said i liked
it so what's up what'd you call
my couch is pink uh-huh yeah and that's
that's why i like it because it's pink
it looks really nice so what's up what'd
you call me
my couch is pink yeah i know did you
just call me over here to brag about
your new pink couch
i mean that'd be pretty annoying if i
invited you over to my house every time
i got new furniture and just rubbed in
what color it was
you know so why did you call me here
because my couch is pink
oh i think i see what's going on you
have brain damage and all you can say is
that your couch is pink no i can say
other things i'm calling you over
because my couch is pink
okay i i mean yeah i can see that it's
pink i
i don't know what else you want from me
oh i want my couch to be red
well then just go get your red couch
back well no no this is the red couch
no this is a pink couch no this is my
red couch oh
okay i think you see what's going on
here is it is that you have color
blindness and this looks pink to you
when it's actually red
okay i think i see what's going on no no
no no no this is my old red couch
what no this is this is a new pink couch
i want my red couch back
well then just go get your red couch
where is it it should be around here
somewhere oh no because this is the red
couch
what no what no no i bought bleach and i
poured it on this couch and made it pink
oh this is the same cow it's the same
kelp
okay i see well what did you need i need
you to help me turn it red again
well i don't really know how to do that
it'd be easy to just buy a new red couch
well so there's no way to turn this
couch back red
no i mean you could try die oh joseph he
said i should die
why would he say that because if i die
my dad can't ground me no
no no no no not like that like like you
should you should
try to try to die the couch oh kill the
couch actually
we should kill the couch if we kill the
couch the couch will bleed and then the
couch will turn red
what no get the knife no no no no no
that's not what i mean i mean die with a
y
die with a y die with a reason why die
cause the reason i want to die is
because my dad's gonna grab me so i so i
have a reason to die
no no no haven't you heard like you die
something
you die something you kill something we
should kill my dad
if my dad's dead he can't ground me he's
a doctor why is he suggesting
no no i'm not saying that haven't you
ever heard of like you know like
die don't you know what die is yeah when
you die you never come back
no no it's a different kind of die oh
like you go to heaven or you go to hell
no
and we can say hell because the new
pixar movie said hell and i guess that's
kid friendly oh my god no
no no haven't you ever heard of like
like hair dye yeah when you shave your
head you kill all your hair no
oh my god no you're such an idiot oh

is that you in order to fix this couch
is you should diet
i should lose weight no oh my god he's
confused yeah so i should go on a diet
and my couch will go back to being red
look i thought your dad had alzheimer's

have lost like a spelling bee when he
was like in middle school
and he's still crying about it it's
d-i-e that's how you spell die
jesus christ no okay you know what no no
there's no way to fix this couch it's
stuck like this forever i'm sorry but
what if i go on a diet will that make it
red no

every day dude like when he tells
parents like oh you can't do it like he
