you green eggs and ham
green engine ham yes green eggs and ham
what wha how how how did they do that
how'd they do what
edging ham can't be green it's just a
book jeffy well i want green eggs and
ham
you can't have it it doesn't exist it's
just a book well your guy on your book
has it
because it's a book jeffy well i want
green next to him i want green eggs here
i want to go just listen to the story
marvin we can figure out how to make
green eggs and ham well no we can't
because it doesn't exist
or exist in the book because it's a book
jeffy
marvin the sooner he goes to bed the
sooner we can have grown up alone
bonding time
but i don't know how did my great exam
cause this exists it can't be that hard
we can figure it out it doesn't exist
jeffy while we go make your stupid green
eggs and ham just try to read the book
oh yeah look at all that green oh this
is exciting
yeah some green on the ham put some put
some green on the eggs this is fun look
it's looking good
oh yeah work your magic it's very very
green oh yeah he's going to get his
green eggs and ham
oh that's that's gross oh this is more
green okay
oh that's very green egg all right jeffy
here's your green eggs and ham doesn't
that look good
this guy's a liar what this guy is a
liar
he's saying he likes green eggs and ham
that's the point of the book jeffy you
see in the beginning of the book
he doesn't like green eggs and ham and
then he finally tries it and he likes it
well he hasn't even touched his ham yet
so how do you know he likes it
how do you know he hasn't touched his
hand because look if you look on this
page
there's one egg on his fork okay
and then he eats it and makes the
statement that he likes green eggs and
ham
and he hasn't even touched his ham yet i
don't want that he's a liar
maybe because it's a book and that's a
picture you're supposed to assume he's
tried both
because like maybe on the next page he's
ate all his ham right
because on this page he's only on his
second egg
and he still hasn't touched his ham yet
and he's over here rambling on how he
eats green eggs and ham anywhere
anywhere in all capitals oh well no he's
a liar
but with jeffy we work so hard to make
this stupid great looking ham but why
can't he just try it
i don't want that because he's a liar
you know what jeffy look you have your
stupid bedtime story you have your
stupid green eggs and ham you have all
your dum night lights look
as long as you don't bother me for the
whole night i'll be happy so you're
gonna bother me nope
okay so i'm happy adult time adult time
all right we're gonna go have adult time
just stay here with your dumb stupid
dumb book and all your stuff
okay jeffy literally has everything he's
a stupid nightlight a stupid book and
stupid green eggs ham no more
interruptions yeah marvin now we can
finally be alone
