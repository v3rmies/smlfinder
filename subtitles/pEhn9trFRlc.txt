should learn how to cook you not knowing
how to cook her marvin well you know
what how about you become a lunch lady
and then you can decide what's gonna be
on the menu i'll never become a lunch
lady because i actually want a future in
a career

and i think she should learn how to cook
danny you were really mean to that lunch
lady and she's a nice lady she's not a
nice lady and she doesn't know how to
cook well you're ugly
