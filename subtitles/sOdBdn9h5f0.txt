never let anybody know my secret
who's freddy oh how did you know about
freddie look we just bumped the heads i
didn't like it
okay just go get out stop interrogating
me
hey junior what was your dad thinking
about i think i'm adopted now
i also read chef pee pee's mine what was
he thinking about dude i don't know i
don't think i can talk about it yeah
well it's still really cool that you
have superpowers i know
maybe you guys have super powers too
joseph what do you think your superpower
is ooh maybe i have laser vision i can
shoot laser beams up my eyes oh you
should try it
okay
it's like a human time so he's burning
alive yeah
let me see what he's thinking about oh
man i remember when i went to boy scouts
and i said my name was freddy
and i kissed chef pee pee but i told him
that we would never talk about this ever
again
what was he thinking about oh he said he
wants us to call the fire department
he wants water and to be put out you
know that makes sense hello hey you got
a call about a fire yeah my friend's on
fire
oh is he yeah he's like on fire with
flames and everything wait like for real
yeah like for real come on
oh man i really hope this kid doesn't
find out that i'm not actually a
firefighter i'm just a male stripper
when he said that his friend was on fire
i thought he meant he was really hot
like you wanted me to take my clothes
off
well what are you doing come on yeah
okay i'm coming okay my friend's right
here oh my god he's burned to a crisp
what happened
well we wanted to scare my chef so we
got in the microwave when he was making
popcorn and he accidentally microwaved
us and then we all got super powers and
his superpower was the light themselves
on fire and they burned himself to death
okay these kids are nothing futs they
obviously just killed their friend and
then made up the story about the
superpowers afterward
all right so what do i do here uh i mean
i should call the cops but
wait wait a minute i am a cop ah i mean
i have the outfit out in the car
but no no no i don't want to do that oh
god if i arrest him it's going to have
so much paperwork
i just want to go home and need a tv
dinner oh god that'd be good
oh yeah chicken and dumplings oh yeah
wait
wait do i have one in the fridge i think
i do i mean i had one last week but
there's probably still one in there
right
well it's okay if there's not i'll just
go by the store afterward oh god but
that's a whole thing
no no okay okay you know what if there's
not one in there i'll just order pizza
on the pizza man oh man i have so many
jobs and i can't even afford to pay the
bills
what's going on oh i don't know it's
been a really long time and i haven't
said anything these kids probably think
i'm crazy
they probably know i'm a male stripper
and i don't know what i'm doing uh
i i i can't help you sorry bye
so junior what was that guy thinking
about the whole time i don't know
something about eating chicken and
dumplings ooh
