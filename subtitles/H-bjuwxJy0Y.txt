what is that
it's the letter a you told me to write a
letter so i chose the letter a
black yoshi you're not supposed to write
one letter you're supposed to write a
bunch of letters
but that would take a really long time
this already took me like 25 minutes
and i even had to google what the letter
a looked like
and what helped me remember is i was
like hmm it looks like a mountain with
snow on top
see they go to snow very good black
yoshi you learn how to write the letter
a
but you have to learn how to write a
bunch of sentences you need to say
hey tom brady i found your super ring
and i'd like to give it back here's how
to contact me
oh so you just want me to write some
words
yes write some words oh okay all right

yoshi
one hundred thou wow that's a hundred
thousand i know okay
black yoshi tomb brady is not gonna pay
you 100
for a super ring back all right well
then he must not want his ring back then
oh no he wants it back he wants it back
but this does not sound like a friendly
letter
offering it to him back this sounds like
a random note well he owes me a reward
he does not owe you a reward like yoshi
yes he does it could have fallen into
the wrong hands
it did if it fell into your hands you're
the wrong hands
you're asking for 100 thou wow okay well
i could have asked for more
should i no you should not ask for any
money you should give it back
for free you know what do not send him
this letter i'll write him a letter oh
which letter you gonna choose from the
alphabet
like the letter b no black i'm not gonna
choose one letter i'm gonna write a
whole bunch of letters
oh you must have a lot of time on your
hands it's not gonna take me 25 minutes
to write one letter black if you look
look
if we send this letter to tomb brady the
cops are gonna be knocking on our door

think why i'm here has something to do
with why you screamed i i only screamed
because i was so shocked that you were
here look i was working at my restaurant
job earlier and then tom brady came in
with his family arranged to have dinner
like he always does and apparently he
left one of his rings there
then later your friend that lives here
came over and i think that he
found tom brady's missing ring and took
it home with him so listen
he's not in any trouble as long as he
gives us the ring back okay look my
friend did find the ring
and he's willing to give it back we were
just trying to find a way to get a hold
of tom brady because you know he's so
famous and we didn't know how to get a
hold of him so we were just trying to
figure that out we could have just
called me
well cece that that's why i screamed
because we were typing in 9-1-1 to call
you
and right before i click dial you showed
up so i was scared like oh he's a
psychic
yeah for some reason i don't believe
that well look we want to give you the
ring back we have it just come up we'll
give you the ring
great cool it's so shiny all right black

oh he did the x-ray and he wasn't lying
because there is a ring in there well we
have to get it out well that's not the
only concern because we also found a
spoon
jeffy how do you swallow a spoon well i
was eating ice cream with a spoon in my
mouth and i was singing that i'm eating
ice cream with a spoon in my mouth shawn
and it goes like this i'm eating nice
cream with a spoon in my mouth with a
spoon in my mouth
in my mouth in my mouth and i swallowed
it did it hurt
yeah well we need to get the ring out
first so how do we get it out well the
quickest and least invasive way is for
him to just
dooky all right jeffy use the bathroom
well i don't have to right now we'll try
well you want me to do it in my pants
yeah i don't care just do it
okay
did anything come out no but i peed a
little bit
you peed yeah now there's pp in my
underwear you don't wear underwear well
then there's pp in my pants
oh look jeffy go sit on the toilet and
keep trying and let us know if something
comes out
okay daddy see black ops you look what
you did
well i didn't know he was gonna eat it
when's jeffy gonna use the bathroom
am i still gonna guess a reward no
hey danny i did it will you use the
bathroom uh-huh was the super bowl ring
in it oh yeah
oh thank god all right so we're gonna
wash it off and give it to tom brady
well i flushed it
do what i flushed it you
flushed the super bowl ring down the
toilet
why would you do that because it was
covered in poop daddy we were gonna wash
it off jeffy
why would you want that if it's covered
in poop we needed it jeffy to give it
back to top rating
but daddy you always get mad at me for
not flushing the toilet and the
one time i flushed the toilet now you're
still mad at me there's no making you
happy
you said if it's yellow let it mellow if
it's brown flush it down and i flushed
it down daddy
this is the one time you actually
remember to flush the toilet out of all
the times you don't flush
you flush it when there's a superbowl
ring in your boot but you
were gonna yell at me and i don't want
to be yelled at well you're definitely
gonna get yelled at that because we did
that
right clearly okay so what are we gonna
do
the the super bowl ring is flush down
the toilet well
looks like tom brady's going up against
the browns in the super bowl
no he's not it's going to be the saints
at the chiefs and the saints are going
to win
because they want drew brees to get one
more ring before he retires so rigged
okay well in any case i'm gonna go
spelunking through the sewers for that
ring
mario i'm starting to get hungry again i
don't care
all right i got it you found the ring
yeah what took you so long well they had
to swim through a sewer i mean do you
know how many things i grabbed that
weren't rings they were all just turds
oh well oh god what's that smell yeah
that's probably me
it took 30 showers but i don't think
this smells ever going away
do i still guess a reward no but i
helped you find it i had to dig through
a sewer to find it
but you would have never found it if it
wasn't for my health well if it wasn't
for you it wouldn't have been in a sewer
to begin with black yoshi you're not
getting a reward just be quiet
all right i guess i'm gonna take this
dirty ring to tom brady if he even still
wants it
all right black yoshi i hope you learned
your lesson yeah next time i'll just put
it on ebay
no that's not the lesson
