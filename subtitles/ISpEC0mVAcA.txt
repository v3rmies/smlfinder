well can i copy your answers yeah sure i
don't want to do that it's gonna take
forever
i can't believe the teacher gave us
homework during spring break i know
junior i hate our teacher i wish i could
call them the stupidest meanest names
ever and not get in trouble yeah i wish
i could send a long text message and
call a bunch of names
and then not get in trouble well you can
always just write up a mean angry text
and then not send it to him
what's the point not sending it you
won't see it well you would type out all
this stuff you want to say to him you
know just to get all that anger out of
your system and then just delete it
before you send it
oh so it's like it's like i sent it to
him but i didn't really send it to him
yeah exactly well i want to do that
already on it junior oh what are you
saying all right so far i got
dear jackie chu it's jeffy you are a poo
poo head
i wish you were not our teacher anymore
you suck at teaching and you smell like
a dirty bathroom
oh i'm telling them i think he's ugly or
he's stuck or something okay i have
junior also hates you too yeah yeah yeah
tell him to tell him cody hate from two
wait wait but that's not actually
accurate well
we're not actually sending it so so
what's the meanest thing what's the
meanest thing you can say about the
teacher i guess you're right uh
telling me stinky yeah yes stinky yeah
say stinky
tell him that he's stinky i want him to
know that he's stinky are you gonna
write that
write down how stinky he is i want him
to know that i think he's stinky say
that those exact words that he's stinky
okay cody also thinks you're stinking
yeah i do
okay okay what else you're saying oh i
also have you're ugly
stupid and dumb yeah you have a phd in
sucking oh yeah i like that i like that
let me let me read it let me read it
also put f homework
uh jeffy more why is the text blue
i don't even know did he send that text
i think he said it he said it cody did
jeffy you can't send that champs are
gonna get suspended yeah
why why would you send it i don't know i
didn't mean to oh my god
we have to stop the teacher before you
see that text junior
i i can't get suspended i've never been
suspended in my entire life we're not
gonna get suspended because the
teacher's not gonna see this tux we're
gonna break it to the teacher's house
and we're gonna start we're gonna grab
his phone and
we're gonna let him see okay junior what
are the odds that he hasn't read it yet
well
it says it's delivered it hasn't said he
read it yet so let's go to his house and
just hope he doesn't read it yet okay
okay let's go guys let's go all right
guys we're at the teacher's house all we
have to do is go inside the house grab
his phone and delete the text before he
ever sees it well how do we know if he's
even home
well if he's not home we'll just wait in
the closet until he goes to sleep and
grab his phone
okay but how do we get in the house we
just go in but it's probably going to be
locked junior people don't walk their
doors
of course they do people it's unlocked
see cody okay maybe this will be easy
all right jeffy just just open the door
and don't touch anything don't break
anything okay let's go
that was sick what just happened i don't
know why do you think you have all these
dominoes lined up
i don't know do you think he has kids i
don't know junior do you think he's home
well apparently not because they didn't
come running when a thousand dominoes
just fell over
let's see where it went to yeah let's go
follow him okay
uh cody it leads to this if this paper
is wet someone broke in junior this is
his security system his security system
yeah it's like some kind of weird
chinese trap for burglars
what's it do well i think whenever he
comes home when he sees all his dominoes
fell down his paper's wet he's gonna
know someone broke in
what do we do i don't know junior he's
clearly a lunatic i mean what does he do
set this up every time he leaves the
house i think we should just leave
cody if we leave then we're gonna get
suspended and you can't get suspended so
this is what we're gonna do
we're gonna reset up the dominoes remake
a piece of paper that says that
and refill up a couple of brown liquids
he'll never know that someone came in
his house but judy that's gonna take
forever he'll be home by the time we're
done
the more talking you do the more time
you'll be setting up dominoes there's a
dominoes
all right jeffy you're gonna fill up a
cup of brown liquid all right i do have
to go to the bathroom show i'll be right
back okay and i'm gonna i'm gonna remake
this piece of paper
almost done hey cody that's good
hold on junior i just have a few more of
these i have to do i just gotta get this

yeah it was supposed to be a liquid oh
well we can put water in there and then
put it in the blender no no this whole
plant sucks we should just leave and get
suspended cody we're not getting
suspended we put too much time and
effort in this plan well how do we even
know he hasn't seen the text yet well
he hasn't called us or replied so you
would think if he saw it he'd be mad
what are we gonna do junior well here's
what we're gonna do we're gonna clean up
the dominoes and we're gonna make it
look like that he thinks that he didn't
set up the security system before he
