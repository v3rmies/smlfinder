okay cody what spit it out
why'd you eat the hot dog i'm sorry
junior i just can't help myself hot dogs
are my favorite food whenever i see a
hot dog i eat it
yeah i know okay so now that i don't
have a big hot dog
and i don't have abs the only thing i
can have left is money that's how i get
her junior you'd have to have millions
of dollars for a girl to like you
yeah and i can't raise millions of
dollars
okay there has to be another way to get
a body like you cody well we could
call a doctor maybe there's some kind of
surgery he could do yeah let's call a
doctor
yeah hey there somebody call a duck wow
you are
gorgeous oh my god how do how does
somebody even begin to look like you
well that's why i called you because i
want you to help me look like him
look like him no no i don't think i can
help you with that i think god has to
give you that i don't think anyone can
help you well there's no surgery you can
do to help me look like that
surgery no no science can't make that
happen what am i gonna do carve you out
of marble no that's not happening well
is there any medicine you can give me to
look like him
medicine huh all right kid let me tell
you the story of a guy named lance
armstrong ooh he's the guy who landed on
the moon
no no you're thinking of neil armstrong
lance armstrong was really good at
riding bicycles
oh cool except he wasn't and he won a
whole bunch of races in france
except he didn't you see because the
reason he won all those races
is because he was using steroids to make
himself stronger and faster
and then whenever people found out about
it they took away all of his medals and
one of his balls
well can i do steroids no the whole
point of the story is that you wouldn't
want to do steroids well he got stronger
well it also made his hot dog smaller oh
well i can't do that i need a big hot
dog i'm trying to get a girl yeah right
exactly
okay so there's nothing you can do well
i mean my advice would be just do
whatever this guy tells you because
whatever he's doing it's working
what if he tells me to eat cut poop then
i'd be eating cat poop right now if i
get to look like that at the end of it i
mean jesus i
i want to paint you i mean you you are
just incredible you
you belong in a museum i mean what's it
like does it feel like you're constantly
wearing a suit of armor
i mean yeah a little bit oh my god that
that is incredible huh oh you you you
have a good day
i guess i'm just gonna give up cody give
up give up
well don't instead just listen to this
song i made for you you'll be real hunky
