all right daddy i actually have one more
problem what fall guys is for the

and all i have is an xbox one so i was
wondering if you could buy me the
playstation 4
because it's only 400 bucks chevy i
don't have 400 bucks
well you were pulling out 20s like it
was nothing jeffy i had 20 bucks i
didn't have 400
if you want to playstation 4 you have to
wait till christmas christmas the
playstation 5 will be out by then
and no one's going to be playing fall
guys they're going to be playing get up
guys or something or just find a game
for the xbox jeffy what do you want me
to play on the xbox
fortnight no one plays fortnite anymore
well jeffy i'm not gonna buy you a
playstation 4 so just play with your
xbox well what do you want me to do go
steal a playstation 4. well we'll go do
that and see what happens
10 20 back
[Laughter]
boom daddy check that out that's a ps4
but what i like to call it is a
pps4 because it's so
pvp jeffy how did you get a ps4
i stole it i got the four finger
discount daddy it only got four fingers
you stole it
me i sure did daddy why because you told
me to
i did not tell you to steal it you said
do it no i did not
bruh you said do it and see what happens
and see what happens that's a free ps4
daddy it's not a free ps4 jeffy you
stole it did i pay any money for it
daddy
no three will you study it's not three
jeffy it's three you were supposed to
three
it's not free free there's so much three
if it's the cops you're not gonna be
free yeah uh hello
you okay buddy yeah everything's fine
officer what are you doing here well
your reaction tells me you probably know
what i'm doing here i have no idea why
you're here i don't know anything about
a stolen ps4
well that's funny you should say that
because somebody just stole a ps4 from
target
and in the security footage it looks a
lot like your son jeffy jeffy oh he
moved out a month ago he doesn't live
here anymore oh really yep jeffy does
not live here anymore
so jeffy's not here no jeffy is not here
i haven't seen him he's definitely not
here
where he saw what
it doesn't matter now i've seen him i
know he's here he's not here
that wasn't jeffy that was my
grandfather go back to bed grandpa i'm
here every day i'm pretty sure i know
what your kid looks like
i'm coming in okay well well well
there's the stolen ps4 what do you have
to say for yourself jeffy
my daddy told me to do it what oh really
no i said do it and see what happens and
see what happened
i got a ps4 for me huh i don't know this
is kind of confusing
is it your fault for telling him to
steal the ps4 probably sarcastically
or his fault for actually stealing the
ps4 from the store
it's his fault i don't know i'm gonna
have to call for backup uh just pretend
there's a walkie-talkie right here
come in i need backup over did somebody
call for backup
outbacked up earlier until off their top
and clogged my drain
hey oh god these two what's the hard
predicament you're in officer and amy
dickham it
ugh okay look this kid right here stole
this ps4 but his dad told him to but he
was being sarcastic so i don't know
whose fault it is
i think they both need a spanking i want
to join their group i think i stole it
too
you don't have to steal to get your
spanking oh god okay just focus you two
where's your uniform i lost it but i'll
get on all fours to try and find it
you don't you don't hit that don't have
to do that i'm backing it up two two
no no two okay look i figured it out i
don't need backup
what happened well the kids stole the
ps4 it's right there look i'm fine i
don't need your help
okay looks like this is open and shut
come on officer bottom i think there's a
crime scene in the next room we need to
explore
sounds like a good time oh god i feel
like i need a shower
so what's happening officer well now i'm
going to go get tested and then i'm
going to take jeffy to jail what's a
jail over 4-4

acting good
yeah yeah tell them how bad jail is oh
you don't want to be a jail
there's no electricity there's no air
conditioning
there's not even a body over there i
gotta poop in the corner then wipe my
butt with my hands
smell it smell it your hands smell clean
it's cause i just washed them up we only
get to watch once a month yeah yeah
tell them about the food oh man the food
is horrible we only got ham and cheese
sandwiches
that's not so bad you gotta make it
sound worse than that
well it is bad when you got to put it
between the inmates but she can then eat
it
yeah yeah i i've seen him do it oh yeah
you wouldn't last long here either you
cute
wait you ain't supposed to kiss back
tell him what you'll do to him
if you see him in there oh don't let me
see you in here
cause if i see you in here yeah he'll
he'll bop ya
that's why he's here he was the chicago
bopper he kept he kept bopping people
or he stole the bop it from target but
anyway jeffy now do you see why jail's
bad well it doesn't seem so bad
you get to poop on your floor which i
don't even get to poop on the floor at
my house
and you get to eat ham and cheese
sandwiches which is better than eating
green beans because green beans are
disgusting
but but you gotta eat the sandwiches out
of somebody's butt which is still
better than eating green beans have you
ever eaten green beans
yeah yeah they're disgusting all right
jeffy come on let's try something else
wait wait let me out i need a part all
right so the prison thing didn't work
but i have a new idea i paid this
homeless guy five bucks to pretend he's
jeffy from the future if he doesn't
straighten up oh so if jeffy sees how
bad he is in the future he's not gonna
act bad anymore yeah exactly
okay i'm gonna tell jeff we got a time
machine jeffy get in here
what's up daddy so uh don't tell anyone
but we have a time machine oh
really yeah we have a time machine and
we went in the future and we grabbed
your future self if you keep acting bad
so jeffy meet jeffy hey
my name is jerry no your name is jeffy
jerry not jerry jeffy
jerry well this is your future self you
change your name to jerry in the future
because you're so bad
why'd you smell like pee what because he
keeps peeing his pants
you can't pee your pants if your pants
are down
well you're that daddy you have a time
machine
so you literally could have grabbed
anything from the future
you could have grabbed a cure for cancer
you could have grabbed a flying car
but no you had to grab this bum well i
was just trying to show you how bad your
future will be if you keep acting bad
jeffy
it's not working okay i have a new idea
we're gonna show him his future self if
he's good
let's do that now jeffy this is the
future you if you stop doing bad things
hey fat boy i got all the money and all
the honey i'm catching checks and eating
grass without the gr
yeah jeffy this is the future version of
yourself who's really successful and
doesn't do bad things
yeah i don't laugh i don't steal i just
do good things
so what version of yourself do you want
to be the future rich version or the
homeless man i mean the homeless version
of yourself
well daddy obviously i want to be the
future rich version of myself so that
means you can't steal or do bad things
you have to stay in school and study you
can't be
mean yeah daddy i understand um
is it okay if i talk to future shelf for
a minute
yeah i guess so um let's leave them
alone i think it's working okay
scooter check it i know it's you dog so
why don't we take all this cash and go
buy a brand new ps4
and play fall guys okay all right you're
ready
yeah watch out i'm doing it i'm doing it
i think jeffy learned his lesson
scooter what do you do out of costume i
don't know wait where's all my money we
both played tasting bar with us i played
this at four
you what that was my money i got it when
i pulled somebody over and searched
their car
jeffy you just stole this officer's
money daddy i didn't steal any money i
borrowed it from future me
what well he kind of has a point what
are you talking about well we told jeffy
that was future him so as far as he's
concerned he didn't steal anything he
just borrowed it from himself
you thought that was a future version of
yourself so he got a loan from the
future version of himself
yeah i mean this is a technicality but i
really don't want to call back up again
so you don't care well i guess you can
get away with this one
well jeffy did you at least learn your
lesson yeah daddy i learned my lesson
i just got a question do you have any
more future me's running around your
house carrying a bunch of money because
there's some items in the item shop that
i want
no jeffy but you learn not to steal
right you learn how to do bad stuff
right
yeah daddy i'm dead all right so then
you keep playing your game but
you you know the consequence if you do
bad stuff you'll go to jail and end up
homeless
so what are you gonna do now i'm gonna
go pull somebody over and get my money
back
