man of my word we have to eat this mr
potato head since chef pee pee is
ignoring us
i don't know dude it's kind of hard and
plasticky wait wait it's a note inside
a note yeah let's read it all right
joseph let's read this letter
it looks like it's from chef pee pee oh
dude i do a perfect chef peepee
impression
let me read it you stupid brats turned
me into a mr potato head
tell me back right now chef pee pee was
mr potato head
i guess so well he did have a chef hat
on and he was cooking potatoes
what if he accidentally turned himself
into a mr potato head dude how do we
turn him back
i don't know let me call a doctor hey
there you call a doctor uh yes doctor my
friend was baking potatoes and he turned
himself into mr potato head
oh oh man i've seen this one before you
have
oh yeah it's actually way more common
than you think when you're baking
potatoes and you get trapped in the oven
you can actually turn into mr potato
you can oh no that means shipping potato
head what are we gonna do
tom calm down calm down it's fine it's
an easy fix all you gotta do is put him
in the freezer that'll unbake him and
he'll turn back into a person
all we have to do is put him in the
freezer we can do that that's easy well
hey see the important thing is that you
have all the pieces of mr potato head
before you put them in the freezer if he
turns back into a person you don't have
all the pieces then whatever pieces i'm
missing a mr potato head you're going to
be missing on your friend
whatever piece are missing i'm just
retained will be missing on chef pee pee
well he doesn't have anything he doesn't
have his eyes he doesn't have his nose
he doesn't have his mouth he doesn't
have his arms
well then you better go find those
pieces your friend's going to be a
vegetable
i guess he already kind of is a
vegetable well i mean
we lost all the pieces we threw them
into a ceiling fan
oh sick i know the pieces exploded
everywhere oh
joseph we have to go find those pieces i
mean we have a while right
well no actually see that's the
important thing so you only have about
an hour
to find those pieces or he's gonna be
stuck like that forever only an hour why
well because then he won't be a hot
potato it'll be cold oh
all right justin let's go find those
pieces let's do it all right joseph we
have to find every single piece because
