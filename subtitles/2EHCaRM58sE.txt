buy a costume like a girl costume i can
do it

their kid and we have a kid looking for
his parents it's a match made in heaven
mario i won't let you do that you're
right baby
you're you're absolutely right baby what
was i thinking i was just joking i was
pulling a prank on you but you know what

and scooter will stay here
in case his parents call but mario you
have a cell phone
yeah but me and scooter have to stay
here uh so i can get to know them better
in case we adopt them because
i really like that idea oh mario yeah

balloons heck yeah

word heck
