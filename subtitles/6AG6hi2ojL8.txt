hey daddy i got a question what is it
jeffy when pixar made mrs incredible
why did they give her a union job class
speed license heavy duty dump truck what
are you talking about i'm talking about
that wagon daddy mario don't look
jeffy if you're gonna play with your mrs
incredible doll take her to your room
and does mrs incredible ever get
constipated
what because she's so stretchy shouldn't
it just fall out like laying an egg
jeffy go to your room and when she gave
birth did it even hurt
or because she's so stretchy did the
kids just flop out like fish
jeffy uh jeffy go to your room and play
with your mrs incredible dog we don't
want to hear it
all right daddy he's so annoying
huh who's at the door uh hello hey mario
do you know what this is
uh an egg it's not just any egg it's a
dodo bird egg
a dodo bird egg yeah and dodo birds are
extinct but i bought this egg for 10
billion dollars at auction
and it was preserved in an iceberg so
they told me that it could still hatch
as long as someone sits on it so
me you want me to sit on it yeah because
i was sitting at my desk after i bought
it and i was thinking hmm
who has a big fat lazy butt who doesn't
pay their house payment and who doesn't
have a job
so i was thinking huh that's mario so
hmm
i don't want to sit on a 10 billion egg
because i'm afraid something bad will
happen to it yeah i'm afraid something
bad will happen to it too mario
but that's why i'm going to incentivize
you to be careful with it by saying that
if you
sit on this egg i'll pay off your house
but you'll pay off my house i sure will
mario
i'll definitely sit on i'll sign it so
hard that's what she said and that's how
i ended up with two kids
oh okay look i'll be really careful with
i'll be really careful as long as you
pay off my house all right mario now be
very very careful remember they're
extinct
good thing i bought two you bought two
you spent 20 billion dollars on eggs i
sure did
because my thought was i'll buy a male
dodo bird egg and a female dodo bird egg
and i'll bring back the dodo birds but
that's not gonna happen anymore thanks
to you mario so what you might as well
do is
you might as well scrape that up and
make a 10 billion dollar omelet
oh okay look i'll be super careful with
this one
you better be mario that's 20 billion
dollars
really careful okay okay so you want me
to sell on this until something comes
out that's what she asked
and that's how i ended up with two kids
okay okay okay i'll be really careful
with it
all right okay goodman wants me to take
care of this egg
but i really have to use the bathroom
first and i don't want to put it near
anyone because i don't want anyone to
break it
so i put it right here yeah it'll be
safe right there

that down here was your prank
what the egg inside that shape was one i
got from your refrigerator

touch it
uh hello well i see you didn't make an
omelet no no i didn't what are you doing
here well i came to check on my egg well
your egg is perfectly fine and you can
have it back because i don't want to sit
on anymore
why because i just don't want to sit on
anymore it's uncomfortable
my butt hurts and it's worth 10 billion
dollars and i don't like stressing about
it so here have it back
all right mario nothing happened to it
did it no no nothing happened to it
it's perfectly fine look it's a perfect
round egg no cracks no scratches
no one threw it off a balcony no one
used it as a cue ball while they were
playing pool
uh no one put it inside a save and threw
it down the stairs it's
it's perfectly fine it's the original
egg and it's yours so you can have it
back
okay but it does look a little different
mario no no it doesn't that
that's a dodo bird egg like if you
google dodo bird egg that's what that
looks like it
i just don't want to deal with it it's
stressful i don't want to deal with it
anymore but mario
your butt is so nice and plump it's
perfect
for sitting on eggs you got that dump
truck mario i don't i don't have a dump
truck so you see look
it's a normal normal truck actually it's
not even a truck it's a small car
see mrs incredible has a dump truck you
should hire mrs incredible because she's
got that dump truck i saw it today so
so my butt is not perfect for that egg
maybe your butt would be perfect but not
my butt
okay mario that's fine
why would you do that you really thought
that was a dodo bird egg mario that was
just a regular chicken egg
that was a regular chicken egg
why did you make me sit on it because i
was bored mario
it was me elon musk jeff bezos and bill
gates

making bets on if you would destroy the
aggro knot
