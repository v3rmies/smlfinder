this basketball shot
then i'm going to win the competition
and harry's an idiot and i'm the best
ow jesus oh okay okay that one didn't
count that didn't count okay okay this
time if
if i make this basketball shot then i'm

hunkiest and the coolest and the
smartest and then harry's just gonna
disappear off the face of the earth okay

to say that i'm the smartest and the
best
okay this time if i make it then
i i'm smart and i don't know just
please make it dang it
okay maybe i should focus less on
playing basketball and more on inventing
what if i invented a robot that could
play basketball yeah
or i can invent a basketball that goes
in the hoop
when you throw it okay cody it's time to
get serious let's see
um ooh what if i invented a hat that
whenever you wore it it would tell you
what house you belong to in harry potter
now that's stupid ooh what about a
blanket that whenever you wore it it
turned you invisible
like like an invisibility cloak no
that's stupid too
maybe i should just sneak over to
harry's house and see what he's
inventing so i can get some ideas
not not not because i'm stupid but
because i'm curious
yeah i'll do that okay this is harry's
house now to just peep in the window and
see what i see
uh oh oh his dad's changing
well yeah all right let's see what
harry's inventing
yes yes i think i've done it mother i
found the cure for cancer that's very
nice harry are you gonna take that to
school for your invention tomorrow
yes mother and i'm going to beat that
ninja
cody what there's no way i can beat that
ah i gotta get home and invent something
oh man
there's no way i'm gonna win tomorrow
harry made the coolest invention in the
world i can't beat that i just have to
invent something
man i gotta think about this no
no not now no no
okay fine
wait i've got it why don't i invent a
stupid ray and then i can shoot harry
with it so he'll be too stupid to show
his invention
yeah that's it but that would be
cheating and cheating is wrong
i think i have to go ask my dad for
advice about this
uh dad yes sir is cheating bad it's
cheating bad what's wrong with you boy
look i think that we need to have the
talk the answer is simple son
cheating is not bad it's only bad when
the woman does it because she does it
out of love
we as men we only do it all for impulse
it's only lust
think about it if you're married to a
four and a ten calls you
you gotta do it it's only simple math
son so cheating's not bad
no look cheating is like wheels on the
car you ain't gonna get nowhere if you
don't cheat
no yeah yeah see cheating is also
complicated though
so you know you gotta block calls block
text sometimes
you even gotta turn off your location oh
but what happens when you get caught
oh you gotta lie la la la even if you
caught red-handed lie again
see line is like the steering wheel to
the car that you're cheating in it's
gonna get you to wherever you need to go
to cheat
oh so you're saying i need to cheat to
get what i want mm-hmm
exactly let me tell you a story son i
cheated on your mama last night
wait is this hypothetical no it's a real
story shush
yeah i went to the grocery store and i
seen this girl with a whole lot of water
what's wife dad oh it's waffles and
pancakes all in a bucket
yeah yeah i saw that whop and i was like
i'm hungry i want some breakfast
so i asked about a whop and i ate a
whopper
oh yeah yeah good wow oh oh wait dad
i think i understand what you're saying
yeah yeah so i should cheat
exactly you always gonna win if you
cheat oh okay
thanks dad that's what i'm here for son
all right i've done it
i've invented the stupid ray now
tomorrow at school
whenever i shoot harry with this he'll
be too stupid to show his invention
i just have to make sure i go before him
