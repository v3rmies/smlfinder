explain it do you want to bring an apple
with you no i don't care about the
apples forget about the app then why are
you bringing up apples it was supposed
to help you understand it
okay then explain how apples are
important to this conversation because
it was supposed to represent the tickets
because we don't have enough tickets
joseph do these tickets look like apples
no not at all because they're one
of them that's why you need glasses what

can't go but they're drawings they
couldn't go anyway
junior okay oh it's fine it's fine it's
fine we're gonna go back to the board

have a ticket oh
wow yeah i get it yeah so black people
can't have nice things either
we can't afford tickets yeah he said he
can't afford it because he's black what
are you trying to say
yeah wow yeah why why why the white ones
have tickets and the black one doesn't
no
no no no no no no oh it's too expensive
for them whoa oh they won't
like nice things too and why is there a
wall between the white circles and the
blacks or was that segregation
no no no oh do they have their own water
fountains too what
yeah you're gonna start writing some
stuff like this no you're gonna get
canceled for stuff like this
no no no no no what if that one had a
dream huh that he could go
huh oh he's just not allowed to go think
about that
yeah yeah why did you have to make those
circles white why don't you make those
black and make the
lonely one white wait it doesn't matter
yeah it doesn't matter now oh
i'm a white man it doesn't matter you

you understand dude
the amount of pressure lifted off of my
family's shoulders
okay but do you understand the thing
about the tickets we understand that
using your voice will
make change happen yeah yeah and that
black people can finally go places
yeah okay but do you understand that
this guy does not have a ticket he can't
go buy his own damn ticket yeah why are
we worried about a handout for mr white
man yeah yeah they had to pay for their
tickets
oh so you're saying the white guy should
just be handed a ticket
wow yeah wow yeah privilege okay no
forget you know what forget this entire
part oh now you just want to forget

get rid of the whole board i'm just
going to burn
