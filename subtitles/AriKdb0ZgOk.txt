all right get ready i'm going to wreck
you
all right all right i was playing around
but now i'm not playing anymore okay i
let you get a five-point lead because

i'm cool as a cucumber okay i'm getting
ready to be mad because i'm gonna win
come on come on oh daddy's in oh oh no
no i'm gonna strangle you oh you come
here come here
i can't get out of him but he cheated
hey he put like butter on the puck or
something i don't know he made it faster
oh
you need anger management no come on
let's do another exercise
all right jeffy now we're going to try
pet therapy yeah so whenever you get mad
you just pet a little kitty like this
you know like me whenever i lose an air
hockey you know how that makes me mad
because i was all state and i lose to
some little chump who doesn't really
know what he's doing
and he probably cheated and that's
probably what he won in the first place
which is ridiculous
because i'm a champion but you made the
cat run off
yeah yeah i'm sorry about that okay it's
fine let's try something else
okay all right jeffy now we're gonna try
something i like to call money therapy
which is what i do and all the other
things i try don't work so i just try to
bribe the person to stop being mad so i
can go home
okay all right so i'm gonna sit here and
insult you and every time i insult you
and you don't get mad i'll give you a
dollar how does that sound
sounds good to me all right let's get
started jeffy you are so ugly that when
you were born your mother asked the
doctor if you were a boy or a girl and
the doctor just said ugly
all right here you go all right jeffy
you are so ugly you look like your mom
get pregnant from a dirty toilet seat
okay good it's working jeffy you are
super califragilistic xbl
nope okay that's that's good okay all
right you are so
dumb you wouldn't remember to breathe if
your brain didn't tell you to
wow okay this is working it is working
okay all right you are so
dumb that when you say your abcs you
just stop there
yeah it's pretty good right yeah good
yeah all right all right this is good
this is good
are you always this stupid or is today a
special occasion
all right i think that works it works
okay so if we pay me just doesn't get
mad
yeah i think this is pretty foolproof
now why did you call me all those
games but i gave you the money though no
you have to give me more money to not
get mad
i'm never gonna forget that that's all
the money i have
do you have any money i don't have any
money
why did you tell me those things
do something i don't know let's try
something all right doctor what do we do
i don't know i don't know how about we
just try asking jeffy what calmed them
down the most
okay uh jeffy out of everything we've
done today what calmed you down the most
well i really like the money thing we
can't do that we don't have all the
money in the world well the breathing
exercise helped
oh daddy okay well i don't want jeffy
doing that either would you rather him
go to jail for beating somebody up
no you're just gonna have to live with
it then um daddy can't play video games
all night
no oh daddy please give it to me
oh okay okay fine fine okay fine i
i guess whenever you get mad you can
just do that noise and
just just not just don't beat people up
hey there how's it going
what what what's going on oh this is dr
me that i was telling you about yeah
with twins
