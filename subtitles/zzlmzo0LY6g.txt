kids are terrible why don't we just get
a cat
cats are clean they clean themselves you

a kid it's gonna cost me way more than
ten thousand dollars
i'm gonna have to deal with 18 years of
screaming okay if i can make one payment
to not have to deal with that it's worth
it oh okay yeah

[Music]
jeffy wake up good morning father
jeffy why are you dressed like that oh
these are the clothes that you bought me
by being a very working hard father and
i appreciate it very much
but you've never worn those clothes
before like jeff jeffy like you're
acting really weird what happened to the
pits on your nose
oh well i realized that it was very
unhygienic and i apologize for ever
shoving it up my nostril
jeffy though you're not acting the same
what happened to your helmet oh i
thought it was very foolish of me to
wear my helmet when i was not riding a
bicycle
and i apologize for embarrassing you in
public no no no i don't have time for
you to act like this i understand i
called you a bad boy so now you're
trying to act like a good boy to try to
be sarcastic and be
an idiot but no no i need you to act
like a bad boy because there's a guy in
there that's paying me ten thousand
dollars for you to act crazy and break
stuff and act stupid so
i need you to take this lighter okay
would you like me to light some candles
daddy no
i need to take this lighter and light
the house off finally i'd just be really
bad
because the guy's paying me ten thousand
dollars for you be a bad boy so i don't
have time for you to be a good boy be a
bad boy well lighting the house on fire
would put everyone in danger and that
would be extremely unsafe i need you to
be like that
jeffy stop it you're coming with me to
the other room and i need you out crazy
break stuff just go crazy come on
all right here's my son jeffy it's a
pleasure to meet both of you this
evening
ma'am you look very beautiful oh my gosh
you're so
nice yeah yeah yeah he's really nice
dude what's going on
oh i i think oh oh i see what's going on
you're just making him look nice so that
later when he starts breaking stuff
he'll look really crazy
all right it's a good idea yeah that's
that's what's happening that's
definitely what's happening
all right jeffy um father if it's not
too much trouble i would like to be
called
jeff from now on it sounds more proper
he's so well-mannered
yeah yeah he sure is but when's he gonna
start cussing though oh
don't worry he's gonna start he's gonna
start cussing um oh all right uh jeff
um i found this hammer what are you
gonna do with this hammer
oh would you like me to build an
orphanage for all of the homeless
orphans
he's so caring and selfless yeah yeah
some people would even say he's a little
too
caring and selfless oh no he's gonna go
crazy watch this watch this
all right jeff why don't you take this
hammer and go break a hole in the wall
and yell the f
word really loud well that would be very
immature of me and cost you a lot of
money and damages
and he doesn't fall on that peer
pressure all right all right time out
time out me and mario are going to go
into the other room and we're going to
talk about why jeffy's so nice because i
want to know how you get a kid to act
like that
come on okay jeff and i will get better
acquainted what is going on what the
hell is going on
i don't know he usually acts bad i don't
know why he's acting so good yeah i
don't understand this why isn't he being
bad i don't even recognize that kid in
there i know he was bad earlier look
what he did earlier what
where's this kid i want this kid back i
i sniff butts
that's gold my wife would hate that i
don't know he did this earlier
he even even broke a hole in my wall
earlier well that i i actually did that
a few videos ago but this this is
awesome why can't he do this
i don't know he uh he usually is always
bad i don't know what could have
happened well did you tell him to be
good or something
well actually what well what
earlier i wished on a shooting star that
i wish he would be good for one night
you did what you wished upon a shooting
so everybody knows that when you wish
upon a shooting star it comes true
i i i would sing the disney song but
jiminy cricket would [ __ ] me
well oh i got an idea i got an idea why
don't we just show your wife this wall
and say that jeffy did it earlier and
she wouldn't want him yes yes that's
good that's great that's great okay yeah
yeah we'll show her this
and then we'll just tell them that that
that yeah that he's on meds and that's
why he's being good now yeah
yeah yeah he he always goes crazy but
you have to get a lot of medicine not
good not to not
normal yeah yeah okay okay i'll go i'll
go get that hey baby boy
jeff is the sweetest kid i told him i
was toy scene he got me this bottle of
water
yeah how sweet of him father may i use
the restroom yeah whatever
anyway i did tell her that one thing oh
honey yeah yeah i mean this kid seems
nice but i think this kid is bad news
bad news but he's such a sweetheart yeah
well you're not gonna think that after
you see what he did to this wall come
look
all right honey check this out what jeff
what are you doing oh i noticed there
was some graffiti on the wall so i
thought i would repaint the wall for you
father
oh he's a handyman too what's wrong with
you be normal
whiny why you yelling at him cause he's
not usually like this yeah he's really
breaking stuff and
oh i got an idea what oh really every
time jeff sees some green beans he
throws them
so so let's go down to the kitchen and
try to feed jeffy green beans and then
your wife will see how crazy he is yeah
yeah that's good
oh oh man honey i'm really hungry for
green beans specifically
i think we should go downstairs and eat
a whole plate of green beans
yeah yellow let's go do that come on
come on jeff it's not for eating some
green beans
this looks like a scrumptious plate of
green beans doesn't it
jeff it actually does thank you father
for going to work and working so hard to
provide this amazing meal
shall i say grace what dear heavenly
father
thank you for this food and thank you
for allowing us to live another day
god is good god is great thank you for
this food amen shall we eat our
agreement
no no no we're not gonna do that this is
not how you usually act this whole thing
is bold here's what you're supposed to
do you're supposed to pick up the plate
and you're supposed to throw it like
that
that's what you always do what is wrong
with you
we're going home right now i don't think
you're mature enough to have a kid
really okay thanks man well jeffy i'm
still mad at you the day i need you to
act bad you act really good and i don't
know why you act so good
i need you to act bad but you had to act
so good watching mario
why are you yelling at jeffy he can't do
anything right you're yelling him when
he's bad and now you're yelling at him
when he's good and it just doesn't make
sense let's go
that noise okay hold on
jeffy what are you doing you only wish
that i would be a good boy for one night
and it's the next day so
