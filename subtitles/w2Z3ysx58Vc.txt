because they're bankrupt hmm
i don't want a chuck e cheese because i
have an arcade in my house i don't know
if you buy a chuck e cheese though
your name would be in lights everywhere
everyone be going to richard e cheese's
and everyone would know who you are and
everybody would want to be your friend
hmm
well i do need friends that's actually a
good idea junior
but look let me go ask my dad okay oh
this might work
sigh what's wrong richard that was a
really big sigh did you buy chuck e
cheese

your dad
he's stupid why's he stupid because he
wouldn't let me buy
chuck e cheese why not well i told him
the idea
and he loved the idea well that's good
so we could buy it

to buy it for himself
so instead of naming it richard e
cheese's he's gonna name it good mini
cheeses well that's still good for me i
can start my party there
