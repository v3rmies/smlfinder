time due to legal reasons

jokes taking out things that made the
videos maybe seem too boring or more
filler

and maybe two new and then we'll
remake two old classic sml videos so

get this channel
to a decent amount of subscribers i hate
that our main channel
used to have almost 10 million
subscribers and the last two channels
we've been on
had almost five minutes i had over five
million but hopefully this is the last
time we ever
have to change channels again i know

going to be
you know the same jokes same voice
actors we're gonna work our
butts off to remake all the old videos
i started in 2007. you know we've been
doing this for 13 years
going on 14 years and it's gonna be a
lot of videos remake i've been uploading
two videos a week since 2014
we're going to go back and remake every
single video that we legally are allowed
to
that you know doesn't infringe on
anybody else's rights or copyrights
so uh yeah that's what we're doing now i
can't speak anymore about it
